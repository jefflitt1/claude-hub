# Session Recap: mac_20260122_0613
**Time:** 2026-01-22 06:13 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~14,000 (7 turns × 2000)

## Completed
- Thoroughly reviewed entire Mac Studio migration plan as requested
- Researched and verified all tool selections:
  - Tailscale free tier (3 users, 100 devices - sufficient)
  - VMware Fusion Pro (free since Nov 2024, stable)
  - Jump Desktop ($53 Mac + iOS, native RDP for Windows VMs)
  - grok-cli/grok-mcp options (MCP support confirmed)
  - Ollama + DeepSeek R1 on 32GB RAM (14b and 32b models)
- Fixed Jump Desktop pricing in IT infrastructure doc ($35 → $53)
- Documented user decisions:
  - Mac Studio username: `jgl`
  - Pi 5 AI HAT 2 task: Security camera AI processing (Frigate NVR + Hailo NPU)
  - Docker vs Native MCPs: Docker (docker-compose.mcp.yml)
  - Windows licenses: Try transfer first, then Kinguin keys (~$30-60)
  - Grok integration: `grok-mcp` (MCP-only, not full CLI)
- Updated IT infrastructure doc with finalized architecture diagram
- Updated pending-sql.md with all resolved decision points
- Updated cost summary to accurate $83-113 total

## Decisions Made
- **Mac Studio username**: `jgl` (different from MacBook)
- **Pi 5 dedicated task**: Frigate NVR with Hailo NPU for security cameras
- **MCP deployment**: Docker (easier maintenance)
- **Grok approach**: MCP-only server, not full CLI
- **Windows licenses**: Gray market keys acceptable as fallback (~$15-30 each)

## New Open Items
- None - all migration decisions are now finalized

## Notes
This was a continuation session focused on thoroughly reviewing and finalizing the migration plan. User explicitly requested "only select the tools once" - all selections are now verified through web research. Migration is ready for tomorrow (Mac Studio arrives).

## Files Changed
- `~/.claude/agents/it-infrastructure.md` - Multiple updates (pricing, decisions, architecture)
- `docs/operations/pending-sql.md` - Cost summary, decision points, grok-mcp choice
