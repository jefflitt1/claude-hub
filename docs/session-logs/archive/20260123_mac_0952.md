## Completed
- Migrated full Claude Code MCP setup to new Mac Studio (17 servers connected)
- Set up Mac Studio as always-on central hub
- Configured Ollama with DeepSeek R1 14B and Llama 3.2 models
- Created launchd auto-start services for Ollama
- Set up scheduled Claude automations (morning digest 6:30 AM, inbox triage 8 AM/2 PM, market scan 9:30 AM, hourly health check)
- Created Telegram hub bot for remote commands (/wake, /status, /digest, /triage, /market, /run)
- Configured prevent-sleep settings (sleep 0, disablesleep 1)
- Enabled Wake on LAN (womp 1)
- Enabled Remote Management with full privileges
- Set up Tailscale VPN for remote access (100.87.10.83)

- Added shell aliases (hub-status, hub-notify, claude-digest, claude-triage)
- Configured passwordless SSH between old Mac and new Mac Studio
- Time Machine backup already running

## Decisions Made
- Keep n8n on Pi instead of local Mac Studio instance
- Use Telegram Saved Messages for hub bot commands (not a separate bot)
- Remote Management preferred over Screen Sharing (more features)
- IP changed from 192.168.5.35 to 192.168.5.38 during session

## New Open Items
- Pi SSH access from Mac Studio needs key added (permission denied)
- Google Sheets MCP OAuth credentials added but may need browser auth
- Could add DeepSeek R1 32B model for better reasoning (optional)

## Notes
- Tailscale network includes: Mac Studio (100.87.10.83), MacBook Pro (100.107.64.112), Pi/n8n (100.77.124.12), iPhone (100.102.117.40)
- Hub bot tested successfully - /wake command working
- All 17 MCP servers connected on new Mac
