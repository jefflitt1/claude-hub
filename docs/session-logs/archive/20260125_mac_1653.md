**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~30000

## Completed
- Reviewed entire Cloudflare DNS and tunnel configuration for l7-partners.com
- Created missing DNS records: `studio-ssh`, `kuma`, `vnc`, `ollama` (pointing to correct tunnels)
- Cleaned up n8n-tunnel config: removed dead `admin.l7-partners.com` route (DNS pointed to Netlify)
- Removed VNC and Kibana routes from n8n-tunnel (unused services)
- Deleted orphaned DNS records for `vnc.l7-partners.com` and `kibana.l7-partners.com`
- Added `ollama.l7-partners.com` DNS pointing to mac-studio tunnel
- Verified n8n.l7-partners.com has Cloudflare Access protection (302 redirect to Zero Trust login)
- Verified kuma.l7-partners.com has Cloudflare Access protection
- Implemented 9 new Cloudflare Access/Zero Trust tools in cloudflare-mcp:
  - `list_access_apps`, `get_access_app`, `create_access_app`, `update_access_app`, `delete_access_app`
  - `list_access_policies`, `create_access_policy`, `update_access_policy`, `delete_access_policy`
- Updated cloudflare-mcp to v1.1.0 with Zero Trust support
- Built and compiled updated MCP server

## Decisions Made
- Keep Uptime Kuma (kuma.l7-partners.com) - useful for monitoring
- Remove VNC and Kibana - unused, reduce attack surface
- Add Ollama API endpoint for remote LLM access
- Cloudflare Access protection needed for ollama.l7-partners.com

## New Open Items
- User needs to restart Claude Code to load new Access tools
- Create Cloudflare Access app for ollama.l7-partners.com (after restart)
- Update mac-studio local tunnel config to add Ollama route (localhost:11434)
- Consider consolidating SSH endpoints (mac-ssh, ssh, studio-ssh)
- Trading VM routes still have placeholder IPs

## Notes
- n8n-tunnel now v31 with 6 clean routes
- mac-studio tunnel is locally managed (can't update via API)
- Cloudflare Access API follows pattern: apps → policies (nested)
- Policy rules support: emails, email_domains, groups, everyone, MFA requirement
