# Session Recap: mac_20260120_1955
**Time:** 2026-01-20 19:55
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Discovered Claude Hub dashboard is part of l7partners-rewrite repo (same codebase as L7 Partners site)
- Synced local clone with latest from GitHub (2296 lines added including HomeSection.tsx, CommandPalette.tsx, PinnedItemsSection.tsx)
- Updated claude-agents CLAUDE.md with Lovable sync architecture and workflow
- Updated l7partners-rewrite CLAUDE.md with Claude Hub component documentation
- Created docs/operations/lovable-workflow.md with complete two-way sync guide
- Committed and pushed documentation changes to both repos

## Decisions Made
- Document the two-way sync architecture: Lovable <-> GitHub <-> Local Clone
- Best practice: Use Lovable for UI/design, Claude Code for logic/bugs/refactors
- Always git pull before editing locally, git push after changes

## New Open Items
- None

## Notes
Key insight this session: The Claude Hub dashboard frontend lives in the same Lovable project and GitHub repo as the L7 Partners site (l7partners-rewrite). This was previously unclear. Comprehensive documentation now exists in docs/operations/lovable-workflow.md.
