# Session Recap: mac_20260116_1516
**Time:** 2026-01-16 15:16
**Terminal:** mac
**Project:** JGL Capital Trading System

## Completed

### Markplex Scraper v2
- Built comprehensive Playwright-based scraper (`scripts/markplex-scraper.js`) to capture full Markplex membership content
- Fixed login URL issue (site changed from `/wp-login.php` to `/login/`)
- Added flexible selector fallbacks for form elements
- Implemented progress saving for resumable scraping
- Successfully scraped **445 files** total:
  - 103 program pages
  - 232 tutorial pages
  - 104 quicktip pages
  - 6 training course pages
- Total content captured: **4.5MB** of markdown with embedded code blocks

### Knowledge Base Creation
- Updated `.claude/skills/tradestation/markplex-knowledge.md` with actual code examples extracted from tutorials:
  - Vector Operations (Tutorial 90) - complete working code
  - Vector QuickSort (Tutorial 95) - recursive sorting for rankings
  - Dictionary Class (Tutorial 121) - pivot tracking pattern
  - Global Dictionary Sender/Receiver (Tutorial 148) - RadarScreen communication
  - Price Series Provider (Tutorial 86) - multi-timeframe calculations
  - Trailing Stops (Tutorial 80) - dollar trailing with visuals
- Added new section: "Patterns for Self-Weighting Portfolio System" with three architecture options

### Strategy Recommendations Document
- Created `data/analysis/markplex-learnings-summary.md` with:
  - Recommended hybrid architecture diagram
  - Critical code patterns for self-weighting system
  - Implementation roadmap (4 phases)
  - Relevant Markplex resources by category
  - Key gotchas from content analysis

### Quant Agent Enhancement
- Updated `.claude/agents/quant.md` with relevant Markplex patterns section
- Added references to key programs for multi-symbol analysis, cross-chart communication, and ranking logic

## Decisions Made
- **Architecture for self-weighting system**: Hybrid approach using Master Trading App + GlobalDictionary + Individual Charts
- **Key patterns identified**:
  - GlobalDictionary for real-time allocation sharing
  - Price Series Provider for multi-symbol analysis from single chart
  - Vector QuickSort for ranking symbols by score
  - StreamReader for dynamic symbol list import
- **Scraper output format**: Markdown files with embedded EasyLanguage code blocks in separate sections

## New Open Items
- Build prototype with 5-symbol basket using recommended architecture
- Test GlobalDictionary communication between master app and individual charts
- Port _VectorQuickSort function to JGL Capital codebase
- Implement scoring methodology (momentum/volatility based)
- Create strategy template that reads allocations from GlobalDictionary

## Notes
This session completed the Markplex content capture and analysis that began in a previous session. The scraper required manual intervention for login (Markplex uses a non-standard WordPress login flow). All 445 files are now available in `data/markplex-tutorials/` organized by content type.

The Quant agent now has comprehensive EasyLanguage code examples and architectural patterns directly applicable to the self-weighting portfolio challenge. Three architecture options documented with pros/cons.

Key insight: The GlobalDictionary pattern from Tutorial 148 combined with Price Series Provider from Program 39 provides the foundation for cross-chart portfolio coordination without requiring external systems.
