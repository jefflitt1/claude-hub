# Session Recap: mac_20260131_0605
**Time:** 2026-01-31 06:05
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~6000

## Completed
- Configured Mac Studio display sleep to 10 minutes (`pmset -c displaysleep 10`) — monitors now go black after inactivity
- Verified password-on-wake already disabled (`askForPassword = 0`) — no lock screen when displays wake
- Confirmed computer sleep remains at 0 (always on) — only displays turn off

## Decisions Made
- Set 10-minute display sleep timeout as reasonable default (user can adjust)
- No changes needed for password/lock settings — already configured correctly

## New Open Items
- None

## Notes
Quick IT configuration session. Mac Studio was set to never sleep displays (`displaysleep 0`). Single `pmset` command resolved it.
