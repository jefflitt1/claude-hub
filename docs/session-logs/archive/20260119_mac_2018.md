# Session Recap: mac_20260119_2018
**Time:** 2026-01-19 20:18 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~24,000

## Completed
- Verified new MCP tools after restart (session-context, l7_activate_workflow, l7_deactivate_workflow)
- Created `claude_session_context` table in Supabase via SQL Editor
- Fixed bug in session-context server: `supabaseConnected` was checking data existence instead of connection status
- Added `hasPreviousSession` flag to distinguish between connection and data availability
- Rebuilt session-context server with fix
- Inserted test session data for verification after restart

## Decisions Made
- Changed `supabaseConnected: !!supabaseContext` to `supabaseConnected: !!supabase` for accurate connection status reporting
- Added separate `hasPreviousSession` field for data existence check

## New Open Items
- Restart Claude Code to pick up session-context fix
- Verify session-context Supabase connectivity after restart

## Notes
All three optimization options from previous session now verified working:
1. Consolidated MCP tool chains (documented in CLAUDE.md)
2. Session-context MCP server (bug fixed, table created)
3. n8n activation tools (l7_activate_workflow, l7_deactivate_workflow)
