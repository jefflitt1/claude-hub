# Session Recap: mac_20260115_2245
**Time:** 2026-01-15 22:45 EST
**Terminal:** Mac (primary)

## Completed

1. **Pi Disk Space Fixed** - Freed 47GB (98% → 55%)
   - Moved ~/backups (18GB) to USB
   - Moved /var/backups/n8n (31GB) to USB

2. **Pi Setup Completed**
   - Claude Hub running on pm2 (port 3003)
   - MCP servers configured
   - cloudflared routing working

3. **GitHub → Supabase Pipeline Built**
   - n8n workflow: GitHub Webhook → Extract Data → Upsert to Supabase
   - Webhook URL: https://webhooks.l7-partners.com/webhook/github-project-sync
   - Fixed Supabase auth (legacy keys → new secret key)
   - Fixed schema mapping (removed github_url, added id field)
   - Fixed RLS policies for anon read access

4. **GitHub Webhook Added to claude-hub repo**
   - Tested end-to-end successfully

5. **Session Recap Skill Created**
   - `/recap` - saves to session-logs (concurrent-safe)
   - `/recap merge` - consolidates into session-notes.md

## Decisions Made

- Use Supabase as shared database (not GitHub JSON files)
- Use n8n for GitHub → Supabase sync (simpler than GitHub Actions for this use case)
- Lovable for frontend (already polished, connected to Supabase)
- Session logs use timestamped files to handle concurrent terminals

## New Open Items

1. Add GitHub webhooks to other repos (command in session-notes.md)
2. Consider Pi redundancy for n8n workflows
3. Add more entity types (agents, prompts, workflows) to tracking

## Notes

- Supabase project: donnmhbwhpjlmpnwgdqr.supabase.co
- Supabase uses new API keys (legacy disabled 2025-09-16)
- Pi Claude session was outdated - can be closed
