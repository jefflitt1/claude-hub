# Session Recap: mac_20260121_1907
**Time:** 2026-01-21 19:07 EST
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Reviewed ~/Desktop/N8n folder containing ~95 files from Build Room Skool community
- Assessed workflow value for agent integration (Gmail AI Manager, MCP Server Trigger, Knowledge DB, RAG Chatbot patterns)
- Identified exposed API keys needing sanitization
- Created jeff-agent task to track N8n workflow review for later

## Decisions Made
- Tag N8n folder for later review rather than immediate action
- Prioritize MCP Server pattern and Gmail AI Manager logic as high-value extractions
- Low priority task - not urgent

## New Open Items
- Task created: "Review N8n workflows for agent patterns" (jeff-agent, low priority, claude-hub project)

## Notes
Quick session focused on Desktop cleanup/triage. N8n folder contains training materials from Build Room plus ~45 workflow JSONs. Most use Airtable/Pinecone stack (needs adaptation to Supabase). Key patterns worth extracting later.
