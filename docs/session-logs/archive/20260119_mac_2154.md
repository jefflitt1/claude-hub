# Session Recap: mac_20260119_2154
**Time:** 2026-01-19 21:54
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~16000
**Project:** claude-hub

## Completed
- Fixed Telegram Bot routing - rebuilt Master Telegram Bot Conversations workflow with parallel paths (no merging/routing)
- Each bot now responds in correct channel: @JGLCapitalBot, @L7PartnersBot, @MagicAgentBot
- Deleted unused separate workflows (L7, Magic, JGL individual workflows created during debugging)
- Investigated "L7 Action Items" - identified as Master Tenant Management workflow's Telegram integration
- Confirmed L7 Action Items should be kept (OpenAI-powered tenant management, separate from Claude-powered @L7PartnersBot)

## Decisions Made
- Parallel paths architecture chosen over separate workflows for Telegram bots
- L7 Action Items (Master Tenant Management) kept as separate system - different AI (OpenAI), different purpose (tenant/lease RAG queries)

## Architecture Notes
| Telegram Channel | Workflow | AI | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|-----|---------|
| @L7PartnersBot | Master Telegram Bot Conversations | Claude | General L7 queries via Claude Code |
| L7 Action Items | Master Tenant Management | OpenAI | Tenant/lease queries with Weaviate RAG |

## Notes
- Session was continuation from previous context (compacted)
- Telegram bot routing finally working after multiple approaches
- Master Telegram Bot workflow ID: stlQoP2huGVmGzRS (21 nodes, 3 parallel paths)
