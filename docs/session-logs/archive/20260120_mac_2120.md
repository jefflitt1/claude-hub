# Session Recap: mac_20260120_2120
**Time:** 2026-01-20 21:20 UTC
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~12000

## Completed
- Audited all Telegram bots via Telegram MCP and n8n workflows
- Identified 8 bots and mapped each to their active n8n workflows
- Confirmed 2 Claude bots exist: @JeffN8Ncommunicationbot (approvals) and @claudeterminal1463bot (system monitor)
- Identified orphaned unnamed bot (Chat ID 8471835561) for deletion
- Discovered credential inconsistency in n8n error notification workflows

## Decisions Made
- Keep all 7 named bots - each has an active purpose
- Delete unnamed bot manually in Telegram (API cannot delete bot chats)
- @n8nmasteractionjeffbot to remain for now, will eventually be replaced

## New Open Items
- Manually delete unnamed bot chat (ID: 8471835561) in Telegram app
- Optional: Consolidate System Health Check and Critical Workflow Monitor to use @claudeterminal1463bot instead of @n8nmasteractionjeffbot for consistency

## Notes
Bot audit summary:
- @L7Partners_Bot - L7 Partners conversations (Master Telegram Bot)
- @n8nmasteractionjeffbot - Legacy L7 Action Items (Master Tenant Management)
- @JGL_Cap_1_bot - JGL Capital conversations (Master Telegram Bot)
- @jgl_personal_bot - JGL Personal Assistant (Master Telegram Bot)
- @JeffN8Ncommunicationbot - Claude Code Approvals workflow
- @Magic_agent1_bot - Magic Agent conversations (Master Telegram Bot)
- @claudeterminal1463bot - System error notifications (error trigger workflow)

Finding: error trigger uses @claudeterminal1463bot directly, while System Health Check and Critical Workflow Monitor use "L7 Action Items Bot" credential (@n8nmasteractionjeffbot) - all send to same group chat.
