# Session Recap: mac_20260124_1146
**Time:** 2026-01-24 11:46
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~60,000

## Completed
- Verified Tailscale and Jump Desktop auto-start on both MacBook Pro and Mac Studio
- Set up Mac Studio as fully operational Claude Code environment:
  - Built all meta-tools (unified-browser, unified-comms, l7-business, jeff-agent, feedly, session-context)
  - Copied OAuth credentials for unified-comms, google-calendar, gdrive
  - Configured 17 MCP servers in settings.json
  - Installed bun (for apple-notes), terminal-notifier
  - Set up telegram-mcp with uv
- Implemented automatic git sync between machines:
  - SessionStart hook: git pull (get latest from remote)
  - Stop hook: git commit + push (auto-sync on session end)
  - Scripts detect repo path dynamically (~/Projects/ or ~/Documents/Claude Code/)
- Fixed Mac Studio git issues:
  - Discovered iCloud Drive was causing "Resource deadlock avoided" errors
  - Moved repo to ~/Projects/claude-agents (outside iCloud)
  - Switched git remote to SSH for headless authentication
  - Updated MCP server paths in settings.json
- Fixed MacBook git index corruption (removed stale index.lock)
- Configured GitHub CLI (gh) authentication on Mac Studio
- Full round-trip sync tested and working both directions

## Decisions Made
- Auto-sync on session END instead of requiring manual /recap for git push
- Mac Studio repo lives at ~/Projects/claude-agents to avoid iCloud sync conflicts
- Using SSH for git remote on Mac Studio (HTTPS credential helper doesn't work over SSH)
- Scripts check multiple candidate paths to support both machines

## New Open Items
- None - Mac Studio Claude Code setup complete

## Notes
Both machines now automatically sync via git:
- Start session → pulls latest changes
- End session → commits and pushes changes
- No manual action required

Mac Studio path: ~/Projects/claude-agents
MacBook path: ~/Documents/Claude Code/claude-agents
