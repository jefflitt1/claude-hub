# Session Recap: mac_20260116_2250
**Time:** 2026-01-16 22:50
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Researched Apple Notes MCP servers (found community options: RafalWilinski, sirmews, Siddhant-K-code)
- Created Apple Note "Claude Session Notes" for syncing open items
- Set up git post-commit hook to auto-sync session-notes.md to Apple Notes
- Installed pandoc via homebrew for markdown to HTML conversion
- Fixed note name matching issue (Apple Notes uses first line as name)
- Fixed UTF-8 encoding issues - replaced special characters (arrows, box-drawing) with ASCII equivalents
- Removed CSS styling that Apple Notes doesn't support

## Decisions Made
- Chose git hook approach over fswatch daemon (simpler, triggers at meaningful moments)
- Use pandoc for markdown-to-HTML conversion
- Replace UTF-8 special characters with ASCII for Apple Notes compatibility

## New Open Items
- Further refine Apple Notes formatting if needed (tables, code blocks)

## Notes
The Apple Notes sync now works via post-commit hook. When recap runs and commits session-notes.md, the note auto-updates. Special characters like → and ├── are converted to ASCII equivalents for readability.
