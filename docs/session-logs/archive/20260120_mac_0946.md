# Session Recap: mac_20260120_0946
**Time:** 2026-01-20 09:46 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~12,000

## Completed
- Researched Apple Notes MCP servers (found RafalWilinski, Siddhant-K-code, Apple Native Tools options)
- Installed Bun runtime to ~/.bun/bin/bun
- Cloned RafalWilinski/mcp-apple-notes to ~/apple-notes-mcp/
- Installed dependencies with bun install (161 packages)
- Updated Claude Desktop config with apple-notes MCP server
- Verified server starts successfully (uses on-device embeddings)
- Confirmed Apple Passwords has no API (security feature)

## Decisions Made
- Chose RafalWilinski/mcp-apple-notes for semantic search + RAG capabilities
- Used local clone approach (not on npm, requires bun runtime)
- Path: ~/apple-notes-mcp/index.ts with ~/.bun/bin/bun command

## New Open Items
- Restart Claude Desktop to activate Apple Notes MCP
- Add Apple Notes MCP to JGL personal project documentation
- Optional: workflow to push session recaps to Apple Notes

## Notes
User asked about Apple Passwords MCP too - not feasible due to Apple's security model.
No existing Apple Notes integration was found in current setup (user thought there was one).
