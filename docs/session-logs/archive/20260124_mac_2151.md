## Decisions Made
- Reused existing JGLCapitalBot token (8508654295:...) for system monitor alerts
- IT Agent tasks marked complete since skill and documentation already existed from previous sessions

## New Open Items
- System monitor shows Windows VM offline (expected when not running)
- Pi services (n8n, docker) showing as down - may need process name adjustment in SYSTEMS config

## Notes
- Session focused on completing quick-win infrastructure tasks
- All high-priority system monitoring setup now complete
- Remaining high-priority: RAG/document tracking for L7 Partners
