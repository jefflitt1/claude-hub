# Session Recap: mac_20260126_1210
**Time:** 2026-01-26 12:10
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~24000

## Completed
- Fixed Tailscale CLI alias in .zshrc (pointed to missing "Tailscale.app", updated to use homebrew CLI)
- Diagnosed Tailscale conflict: homebrew daemon + App Store app were both running, causing repeated auth requests
- Stopped homebrew tailscale daemon (was conflicting with app)
- Renamed "Tailscale 2.app" to "Tailscale.app" in Applications
- Removed then re-added Tailscale to login items (with correct app name)
- Fixed Chrome "million tabs" issue caused by exit_type: Crashed and session restore
- Cleared Chrome session files containing old Tailscale auth URLs
- Set Chrome startup preference to "Open New Tab page" (restore_on_startup: 5)
- Set Chrome exit_type to Normal
- Verified Tailscale connectivity working (ping to jeffn8nhost successful)
- Verified all changes persist through restarts

## Decisions Made
- Use App Store Tailscale app for VPN (has network extension), homebrew CLI for commands
- Keep homebrew tailscale package installed for CLI access
- Set Chrome to open new tab on startup instead of restoring sessions

## New Open Items
- None

## Notes
Root cause of both issues was related: "Tailscale 2.app" naming caused alias mismatch, and the homebrew/app conflict caused repeated browser auth requests that Chrome was restoring on startup.
