# Session Recap: mac_20260120_2102
**Time:** 2026-01-20 21:02
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~14000

## Completed
- Deep system assessment (CPU, memory, storage, security)
- Enabled macOS firewall (was disabled)
- Cleared ~16GB of caches (CloudKit, Spotify, Playwright, Claude, Homebrew)
- Audited launch daemons/agents for suspicious entries
- Checked network connections and listening ports
- Scanned for malware indicators (none found)
- Verified SIP and Gatekeeper status (both enabled)
- Created IT team notes in Apple Notes with full assessment

## Decisions Made
- Preserved Google/Chrome cache to avoid losing page cache performance
- Documented remote access tools (AnyDesk, TeamViewer, ARD) as potential removal candidates

## New Open Items
- Consider removing AnyDesk if not actively using
- Consider removing TeamViewer if not actively using
- Disable ARD (port 3283) if not needed
- Monitor memory usage - system running at capacity (23/24 GB)
- Review ~/Downloads (4.3GB) and ~/Desktop (9.7GB) for cleanup

## Notes
System is clean from malware perspective. Main concerns are memory pressure (heavy swap usage) and multiple remote access tools increasing attack surface. Assessment saved to Apple Notes for IT team reference.
