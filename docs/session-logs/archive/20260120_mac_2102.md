**Time:** 2026-01-20 21:02
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~14000
**Project:** claude-hub (ai-orchestration)

## Completed
- Set up multi-AI CLI file system structure for Gemini and Codex integration
- Created `ai-orchestration/` folder with shared-context, configs, templates subdirectories
- Created `GEMINI.md` context file for Gemini CLI (large context analysis, research synthesis)
- Created `AGENTS.md` context file for Codex CLI (security review, refactoring)
- Created `ai-orchestration/configs/multi-agent.json` with orchestration workflows (arch-review, security-audit, large-refactor, research-to-implementation)
- Created workflow templates: `architecture-review.md` and `code-review-second-opinion.md`
- Created `ai-orchestration/shared-context/project-knowledge.md` for cross-AI shared knowledge
- Created `/consult` skill for multi-model collaboration (`~/.claude/skills/consult/SKILL.md`)
- Added `/consult` to Key Skills in ~/CLAUDE.md
- Updated GEMINI.md with `/consult` invocation patterns, workflow participation, and expected response formats
- Updated AGENTS.md with `/consult` invocation patterns, workflow participation, and expected response formats
- Added proactive "Multi-Model Thinking" section to ~/CLAUDE.md with decision table and mental checklist
- Added cross-consultation suggestions to both GEMINI.md and AGENTS.md
- Added "Proactive Consultation Culture" to shared project-knowledge.md

## Decisions Made
- Followed best practice of separate context files per AI: CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md
- Claude as primary orchestrator, Gemini/Codex as advisors
- Created `/consult` skill with subcommands: gemini, codex, arch-review, security, second-opinion
- Agents should proactively suggest consulting other models when appropriate

## New Open Items
- Test `/consult gemini` and `/consult codex` with real tasks
- Consider adding more workflow templates as patterns emerge

## Skills Invoked
- recap

## Notes
This session completed the multi-AI CLI integration started in a previous context. The MCP servers for gemini-cli and codex-cli were already configured and connected. Focus was on creating the file system structure and making agents aware of when to use the /consult skill proactively.
