# Session Recap: mac_20260117_2029
**Time:** 2026-01-17 20:29 EST
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Fixed n8n workflow "GitHub → Supabase Project Sync" authentication (changed to `predefinedCredentialType`)
- Added missing `domain` column to `claude_skills` table in Supabase
- Fixed field mappings in Transform Skills code node (`trigger_command` → `trigger`, `project` → `project_id`)
- Tested workflow multiple times - execution 5657 confirmed working

## Decisions Made
- Use `predefinedCredentialType` with `nodeCredentialType: "supabaseApi"` for HTTP Request nodes calling Supabase API
- Workflow field names must exactly match Supabase column names

## New Open Items
- None

## Notes
This was a continuation of earlier workflow debugging. The root causes were:
1. Wrong credential type (`genericCredentialType` doesn't inject headers properly)
2. Missing `domain` column in Supabase table
3. Mismatched field names between workflow code and database schema
