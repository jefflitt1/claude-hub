# Session Recap: mac_20260128_0659
**Time:** 2026-01-28 06:59 - 07:40
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~25,000

## Completed
- Investigated Tailscale authentication/re-auth popup issue
- Confirmed node key expiry settings are correct (all devices set to "Expiry disabled")
- Identified root cause: GitHub OAuth IdP session expires every 30 days (Tailscale-enforced, non-configurable)
- Disabled admin console inactivity timeout
- Evaluated whether a Tailscale MCP would be useful (concluded: over-engineering for this use case)
- Disabled physical power button on Raspberry Pi via SSH (systemd-logind config)
- Investigated n8n workflow errors (GitHub sync, PDF vector, Email Classification)
- Disabled 3 failing n8n workflows:
  - PDF to Supabase (Vector Store) - not needed currently
  - GitHub → Supabase Project Sync - OOM issues
  - Email Classification Pipeline - missing SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY env var in n8n
- Created long-term task for RAG/document workflow re-enablement

## Decisions Made
- No Tailscale MCP needed - 6 machines is too small scale to justify programmatic management
- Accepted 30-day re-auth as expected behavior (doesn't affect mesh network operations)
- Deferred RAG/document workflows to future work - disabled for now to stop error noise

## New Open Items
- Long-term: Re-enable RAG/document workflows after fixing n8n env vars (task created in jeff-agent)

## Notes
- Tailscale re-auth prompts are for control plane only - mesh network stays connected
- Email Classification was failing because n8n doesn't have SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY set
- Pi power button disabled via /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/disable-power-button.conf
