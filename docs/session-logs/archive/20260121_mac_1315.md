# Session Recap: mac_20260121_1315
**Time:** 2026-01-21 13:15
**Terminal:** mac
**Project:** claude-hub (infrastructure)
**Est. Tokens:** ~50,000

## Completed
- Created comprehensive Mac Studio migration package at `~/Desktop/mac-studio-migration/`
- Built 6 sequential setup scripts (01-06) for automated Mac Studio configuration
- Created secrets archive (secrets.tar.gz) containing OAuth tokens, Cloudflare creds, Claude configs
- Documented all 17 MCP server configurations with environment variables
- Created Docker Compose file for containerized MCP deployment option
- Created Windows VM setup guide for TradeStation trading systems
- Prepared MacBook SSH thin client configuration
- Created IT infrastructure agent file (`~/.claude/agents/it-infrastructure.md`)
- Saved migration summary to Apple Notes for quick reference tomorrow

## Decisions Made
- Mac Studio will be always-on Claude Code server, MacBook becomes thin client
- Pi 5 keeps n8n + gets AI HAT 2 for dedicated task (TBD)
- Two Windows VMs needed for TradeStation (platform: Parallels vs UTM TBD)
- Cloudflare tunnel strategy: new `mac-studio` tunnel with `studio-ssh.l7-partners.com`
- Hybrid MCP approach possible: Docker for most, native for macOS-specific (apple-notes)

## New Open Items
- Mac Studio arrives tomorrow - run migration scripts
- Decide Windows VM platform (Parallels $99/yr vs UTM free)
- Determine Pi 5 AI HAT 2 dedicated task
- Configure TradeStation credentials for MCP
- Update Cloudflare DNS to point claude-api.l7-partners.com to Mac Studio after verification
