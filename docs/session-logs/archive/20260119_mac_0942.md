# Session Recap: mac_20260119_0942
**Time:** 2026-01-19 09:42
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Fixed mobile approval hook - added SUPABASE_KEY to PermissionRequest hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Verified Supabase tables exist (`claude_approvals`, `claude_always_approvals`)
- Confirmed Telegram credentials are set

## Decisions Made
- Passed SUPABASE_KEY inline in hook command rather than relying on shell profile sourcing

## New Open Items
- Test the approval flow after restart (send Bash command, verify Telegram notification, Supabase polling)

## Notes
Short session focused on debugging why the approval handler couldn't poll Supabase. Root cause: Python hooks don't source shell profiles, so environment variables from `.zshrc` weren't available. Fixed by adding the key directly to the hook command.
