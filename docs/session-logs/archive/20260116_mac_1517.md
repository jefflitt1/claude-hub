# Session Recap: mac_20260116_1517
**Time:** 2026-01-16 15:17 EST
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed

1. **Diagnosed Daily Digest Workflow** - Found missing connection from "Get Session Notes" to "Merge All Data" node
2. **Fixed workflow connection via n8n MCP API** - Added the missing connection programmatically
3. **Discovered Merge node limitation** - n8n Merge v3 only supports 2 inputs, not 3
4. **Redesigned workflow architecture** - Removed Merge node, connected all 3 data sources (Projects, Agents, Session Notes) directly to Code node
5. **Updated workflow via API** - Pushed multiple fixes directly to n8n without manual UI editing
6. **Improved Code node logic** - Enhanced detection of projects vs agents vs session notes from combined input

## Decisions Made

1. **Removed Merge node** - Direct connections to Code node is simpler and works with any number of inputs
2. **Used $input.all()** - Code node collects items from all connected inputs natively

## New Open Items

1. Test updated Daily Digest workflow to confirm full end-to-end execution
2. Verify email arrives at jglittell@gmail.com after successful test
3. Monitor first automated 6am run tomorrow

## Notes

The Daily Agent Status Digest workflow is at https://n8n.l7-partners.com/workflow/2fwvrmN2I3PDcXRz

Flow: Trigger → 3 parallel fetches → Code node combines → Claude API generates digest → Gmail sends → If urgent, SMS via Verizon gateway (6318383779@vtext.com)
