# Session Recap: mac_20260129_2153
**Time:** 2026-01-29 21:53 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~60,000

## Completed
- Fixed Email Classification Pipeline crash — "Fetch Classified Threads" node was failing every 5 min with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'status')`. Root cause: missing `nodeCredentialType` on HTTP Request v4.2 node. IT agent added the field; also replaced with Code node as fallback (IT agent's fix is what's live).
- Fixed corrupted JavaScript in "Filter Already Classified" node — `\!` escaping issue from workflow re-upload
- Fixed Telegram bot routing — Unified Error Handler was sending notifications to @N8Njeffnewbot via extra "Send Telegram Alert" + "Notify Result" nodes. Removed those, then switched remaining escalation nodes back to native Telegram nodes using credential `gi2zjkVUpSkyuVId` (@N8Njeffnewbot / claude_terminal_bot) per user preference
- Reduced notification noise — Restructured UEH flow: only alerts when auto-fix fails. Added 30-min cooldown node to suppress duplicate errors from same workflow
- Audited all 29 Supabase HTTP Request nodes across active workflows — all have `nodeCredentialType` properly set, no other vulnerable nodes
- Created Google Tasks reminders for PC1 and PC2 BIOS "Power On after AC loss" settings

## Decisions Made
- @N8Njeffnewbot (claude_terminal_bot) is the correct Telegram bot for Claude terminal communications, not @claudeterminal1463bot (claude_system_alerts)
- UEH notification nodes use native Telegram nodes with saved credential `gi2zjkVUpSkyuVId` instead of hardcoded HTTP Request bot tokens
- 30-minute cooldown window for recurring errors in the same workflow before re-alerting

## New Open Items
- iMessage bridge FDA permissions on Mac Studio (may have been done in another terminal)
- Rename n8n credential "Claude Terminal bot - n8njeffbot" to something clearer (low priority, user said ignore)
- PC1 BIOS: Enable "Power On after AC loss" (Google Task created)
- PC2 BIOS: Same setting when migrated (Google Task created)

## Skills Invoked
- recap

## Notes
- IT agent (subagent) was launched first but had permission issues with bash commands. Main session took over and completed the fixes directly.
- The n8n API strips node-level `settings` (like `continueOnFail`) on PUT — workaround is to use Code nodes with try/catch or ensure proper node configuration.
- n8n's external task runner blocks `$env` access in code nodes — must use direct API keys or saved credentials.
