# Session Recap: mac_20260125_1046
**Time:** 2026-01-25 10:46 AM
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~26,000

## Completed
- Audited Cloudflare CNAMEs against Pi services via SSH
- Identified dead CNAMEs: `bot` (404) and `kuma` (no container)
- Verified active services: n8n, supabase, metabase, kibana, webhooks, ssh
- Researched Cloudflare MCP server options
- Created Cloudflare API token with DNS, Tunnel, Access, WAF permissions
- Configured Cloudflare MCP server in ~/.claude.json
- Verified API token and retrieved Zone ID (c4d2f07546dd7f8ddbb84e104c83a100)

## Decisions Made
- Use `@thelord/mcp-cloudflare` npm package for DNS management
- Skip IP filtering on API token (dynamic residential IP from Frontier/SNET)
- Broad permissions granted: DNS, SSL, Tunnel, Access apps/policies, WAF, Firewall

## New Open Items
- Delete dead CNAMEs (bot, kuma) after Claude restart with new MCP
- Consider re-deploying Uptime Kuma or alternative monitoring
- Restart Claude Code to load Cloudflare MCP server

## Notes
- Two Cloudflare tunnels active: Pi tunnel (c5935af7) and Mac tunnel (5e5111af)
- Pi services accessed via Tailscale (100.77.124.12) since CF tunnel SSH was slow
- 22 Docker containers running on Pi (n8n stack + supabase stack + metabase)
