# Session Recap: mac_20260130_1504
**Time:** 2026-01-30 15:04 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~30,000

## Completed
- Migrated all 8 Telegram alert/notification nodes across 6 n8n workflows from old bot (`n8njeffbot` / `gi2zjkVUpSkyuVId`) to new bot (`Claude_terminal_alerts` / `dWNZ1eCwGypATWPv`)
- Workflows updated: Unified Error Handler, Self-Healing Monitor, Critical Workflow Monitor, Fallback Error Alert, System Health Check, Unified System Monitor, Weekly IT Security Scan
- Verified test alert delivery via new bot to Jeff's DM
- Discovered `claude_system_alerts` channel (chat ID `-1003312568605`) doesn't exist / bot not added — reverted to DM-based alerts per user preference

## Decisions Made
- Alert/notification routing stays as DMs to Jeff (`7938188628`), not a channel
- Bot role separation clarified: `Claude_terminal_alerts` for all system alerts, approvals bot for approvals, project-specific bots (n8njeffbot/Claude Hub, JGL, L7, Magic) for conversations
- Master Telegram Bot workflow is Claude Hub's project bot — left unchanged
- `n8njeffbot` freed from alert duty, now purely Claude Hub conversational bot

## New Open Items
- Old deactivated "error trigger" workflow (`OSKEDUq7HqOKiwWw`) still has old bot credential (low priority, already inactive)
- Self-Healing Monitor may also benefit from same audit for any other notification patterns

## Notes
- n8n API requires lowercase `x-n8n-api-key` header (Cloudflare strips uppercase)
- n8n PUT payload must include only `name`, `nodes`, `connections`, `settings` — extra fields cause 400 errors
- Previous session stalled during API work — resumed in new terminal
