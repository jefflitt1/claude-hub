## New Open Items
- None - all 3 enhancements completed and deployed

## Notes
This session built on the previous 9-enhancement session by adding 3 new operational panels to Claude Hub:
1. Workflow Health - prevents cascading errors like Session 10's inbox flood
2. Jeff Agent - makes personal assistant visible (previously CLI-only)
3. Session Analytics - enables data-driven workflow optimization

All panels query Supabase tables: n8n_workflows, jeff_tasks, jeff_email_threads, claude_session_logs
