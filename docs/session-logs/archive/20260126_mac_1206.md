# Session Recap: mac_20260126_1206
**Time:** 2026-01-26 12:06 PM EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~120,000 (60 turns)

## Completed
- Removed redundant MCP servers (supabase-l7, n8n-mcp) from ~/.claude.json - 43% reduction
- Renamed l7-analyst → property-analyst with PROJECT_ID context variable
- Renamed trading-researcher → market-researcher with DATA_SOURCE context variable
- Created skill_project_mappings Supabase table (fixed UUID→TEXT type mismatch)
- Populated skill_project_mappings with initial 13 skill mappings
- Added device roles section to ~/CLAUDE.md (Mac Studio, MacBook, Pi responsibilities)
- Added backup & resilience strategy to ~/CLAUDE.md
- Updated mcp-servers.json inventory with consolidation status
- Created Mac Studio Daily Backup n8n workflow (iGPSOZde0PaSLNsO)
- Configured SSH credentials for Pi→Mac Studio connection (password + key auth)
- Fixed Telegram notification to use correct bot/chat for system alerts
- Added Tailscale IP bypass (100.64.0.0/10) to Cloudflare Access policy

## Decisions Made
- Use local network IP (192.168.5.38) instead of Tailscale IP for n8n Docker→Mac Studio SSH
- Cloudflare Access policies use OR logic - can combine email + IP in single policy
- Backup workflow sends to same Telegram destination as error trigger (chat_id: 7938188628)

## New Open Items
- Week 5-6: Test unified-browser parity, remove playwright/puppeteer
- Week 5-6: Test unified-comms OAuth, remove gmail/gmail-l7
- Configure Cloudflare MCP credentials in ~/.claude.json (empty env vars)

## Skills Invoked
- recap

## Notes
Implemented Phase 1-4 of System Audit & Optimization Plan. Agent generalization now supports multi-project context via contextVars. n8n backup workflow runs daily at 4 AM, SSHs to Mac Studio, compresses ~/.claude/logs/, sends Telegram notification.
