# Session Recap: mac_20260117_1430
**Time:** 2026-01-17 14:30
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Investigated duplicate Claude Hub entries in dashboard (two entries with different names/descriptions showing in Supabase)
- Designed parent-child hierarchy data model with `parentId` field for projects
- Updated `projects.json` with new hierarchy structure:
  - L7 Partners (parentId: null) - top-level business umbrella
  - l7partners-rewrite (parentId: "l7-partners") - child app under L7 Partners
  - Magic Agent (parentId: null) - top-level standalone
  - Claude Hub (parentId: null) - top-level standalone
- Moved repo link from L7 Partners parent to l7partners-rewrite child (where code actually lives)
- Split agents between parent (business-level: chatbot, realestate, deals, investor) and child (codebase-level: codebase, designer, docs)
- Documented required Supabase schema changes

## Decisions Made
- **Chose Option B:** Parent-child relationships with `parentId` field (over Option A: merging entries into one)
- **Hierarchy model:** Top-level = "projects being worked on", children = components/apps under umbrella
- **L7 Partners structure:** Business umbrella with l7partners-rewrite as the technical implementation underneath

## New Open Items
- Add `parent_id` column to Supabase `projects` table: `ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN parent_id TEXT REFERENCES projects(id);`
- Update Supabase records: Set `parent_id = 'l7-partners'` on `l7partners-rewrite`
- Consider setting `parent_id = 'l7-partners'` on `L7 Knowledge Base` (if it should be nested)
- Delete duplicate "Claude Hub" entry in Supabase (keep the "active" one with claude.l7-partners.com URL)
- Update Lovable frontend to render hierarchical/nested project view
- Re-authenticate Supabase MCP (showing "Needs authentication" in health check)

## Notes
- Production dashboard uses Supabase, local `data/projects.json` is reference/legacy
- The two Claude Hub entries have different descriptions: one says "Central dashboard..." (building), other says "Knowledge graph..." (active) - the active one with the URL is correct
- Supabase MCP server is configured at `mcp.supabase.com` but OAuth token appears expired
