# Session Recap: mac_20260130_2040
**Time:** 2026-01-30 20:40
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~30000

## Completed
- Fixed TradeStation "Failed to create file finfo.txt" error on JLDesktop (PC1) — root cause was orphaned SID permissions from deleted jglit user; granted ITadmin explicit full control on 77,592 files
- Scanned entire user profile for remaining orphaned SID (S-1-5-21-...-1001) permissions — clean, none found
- Removed orphaned jglit profile registry key from Windows ProfileList
- Deleted empty `C:\Users\jglit\` directory (NTUSER.DAT + AppData remnants, ~27MB)
- Uninstalled TeamViewer from PC1: stopped service, deleted service registration, removed program files (~250MB) and AppData
- Updated JLDesktop-PC1-verified-config.md with cleanup changelog entry and TeamViewer removal
- Updated CLAUDE.md with jglit cleanup details and TeamViewer removal note

## Decisions Made
- Left `C:\Users\ITadmin\.ssh\` in place — SSH actually uses `ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys`, so it's harmless
- Left scheduled task "Author" fields showing jglit — cosmetic metadata, "Run As User" is correctly ITadmin
- Left WsiAccount alone — Windows system account for Web Sign-in, inactive

## New Open Items
- PC1 BIOS: Power On after AC loss still needs physical access
- PC2 Tailscale: Rename to JLDesktop2 and disable key expiry in admin console

## Notes
- The TradeStation error was a UAC issue: non-elevated processes can't use BUILTIN\Administrators group permissions, so ITadmin needed explicit ACL entries
- TeamViewer silent uninstaller (`/S`) didn't actually remove files — had to manually delete service + directory
