# Session Recap: mac_20260130_1100
**Time:** 2026-01-30 11:00
**Terminal:** mac
**Project:** jgl-capital
**Est. Tokens:** ~60,000

## Completed
- Built full visualization module for JGL Capital trading system (4 files):
  - `visualization/themes.py` — 32 theme constants (candle colors, trade markers, indicator styles)
  - `visualization/chart.py` — ChartBuilder: interactive Plotly candlestick charts with trade entry/exit markers, stop/target lines, winner/loser shading, hover tooltips
  - `visualization/indicators.py` — IndicatorOverlay: strategy-agnostic rendering from plot protocol + `build_chart()` convenience function
- Built full optimization module (4 files):
  - `optimization/sweep.py` — ParameterSweep: parallel grid search via ProcessPoolExecutor, tqdm progress
  - `optimization/comparison.py` — ResultComparator: ranking tables, 2D heatmaps, equity curve overlays
  - `optimization/report.py` — OptimizationReport: self-contained HTML dashboard with sortable tables, heatmaps, equity curves
- Added strategy-agnostic plot protocol to SignalBase (`get_plot_config()`, `compute_plot_data()`)
- Implemented plot protocol in MomentumBreakout (SMA 50, breakout level overlays + RSI, volume, ATR panels)
- Added `result.plot()` convenience method to BacktestResult + stored bars/strategy in result
- Added date range and generation timestamp to chart titles
- Verified full pipeline: synthetic data → backtest → chart HTML/PNG → parameter sweep → dashboard HTML
- Created jgl-capital as independent GitHub repo (jefflitt1/jgl-capital) — matches l7partners-rewrite pattern
  - Merged with existing remote content (older dashboard/scripts version)
  - Added comprehensive .gitignore (output files, secrets, nested repos)
  - Initial commit: 40 files, 4848 lines
- Removed empty `supabase-mcp-server` placeholder from claude-hub
- Pulled 6 new Lovable commits into l7partners-rewrite (Supabase migrations, JGL dashboard tweaks)
- Verified git sync across all 3 repos (claude-hub, jgl-capital, l7partners-rewrite) — all at 0 behind/0 ahead

## Decisions Made
- jgl-capital gets its own git repo (independent, like l7partners-rewrite) rather than staying embedded in claude-hub
- Backtest output files (HTML charts, CSVs, PNGs) are gitignored — regenerated, not source
- `CLAUDE-personal.md` is NOT stale — it's the source for ~/CLAUDE.md, actively auto-synced
- Plotly chosen over matplotlib as primary chart library (interactive HTML, native candlestick support)
- Chart titles auto-include data date range + generation timestamp

## New Open Items
- JGL trading system needs `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` (dependencies only inferred from imports)
- Parameter sweep currently runs serial in test (parallel mode needs `if __name__ == '__main__'` guard on macOS)
- Only 3 trades generated from POC synthetic data — real market data (Alpaca/TradeStation) needed for meaningful optimization
- Consider adding walk-forward analysis to optimization module

## Notes
- Session covered two phases: (1) building the viz/optimization modules, (2) repo organization audit
- The entire `trading_system/` directory was previously untracked — code existed only on local machine. Now safely on GitHub.
- L7 Partners Lovable 2-way sync confirmed working — 6 inbound commits pulled successfully
