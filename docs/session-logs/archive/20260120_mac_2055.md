**Time:** 2026-01-20 20:55 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~16000

## Completed
- Reviewed n8n workflow "PDF to Supabase (Vector Store) - Complete" (SQGYg7V8RO0oiAET)
- Fixed critical error: Added missing `combinator: "and"` to Filter Valid node conditions
- Upgraded 6 node versions to latest:
  - Form Upload: 2.3 → 2.5
  - API Upload: 2 → 2.1
  - Extract PDF: 1 → 1.1
  - Generate Embedding: 4.2 → 4.3
  - Filter Valid: 2 → 2.3
  - Insert to Supabase: 4.2 → 4.3
- Workflow validation: 1 error → 0 errors, 17 warnings → 11 warnings

## Decisions Made
- Left remaining 11 warnings as-is (non-blocking best practice suggestions)
- Two minor fixes (Log Skipped $json mode, Filter Valid onError) deferred - can be done manually in n8n UI if needed
- n8n partial update API had issues with typeVersion changes; used workaround

## New Open Items
- Optional: Fix Log Skipped node to use `$input.first().json` instead of `$json`
- Optional: Add `onError: continueErrorOutput` to Filter Valid node in n8n UI

## Notes
- Original workflow URL had invalid ID (5Rqeuh1perDL7kOK) - found correct workflow via API list
- n8n API returning internal errors on some update operations - may need investigation
- Workflow is active and functional for PDF → vector embedding pipeline
