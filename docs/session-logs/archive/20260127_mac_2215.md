## Completed
- Audited Windows PC (jglit) remotely via PowerShell output analysis
- Identified key software: TradeStation 10, NordVPN, AnyDesk
- Documented 128 GB user profile data requiring review before shelving
- Provided folder-level audit commands for deeper analysis
- Identified Windows 11 Pro RETAIL license key (transferable) to save
- Recommended data preservation checklist (SSH keys, TradeStation configs, browser profiles, local databases)
- Assessed VM migration gaps (TradeStation workspace configs, NordVPN for VMs)

## Decisions Made
- Cannot SSH directly to Windows PC from Mac (no SSH server enabled)
- User will copy/paste PowerShell output for analysis (quickest approach)
- Windows PC being shelved - focus on extracting valuable data, not ongoing access

## New Open Items
- Run folder-size breakdown on Windows PC to identify where 128 GB is allocated
- Export TradeStation workspaces/indicators before shelving
- Save Windows 11 Pro RETAIL license key
- Check for SSH keys, browser bookmarks, and local databases on Windows PC
