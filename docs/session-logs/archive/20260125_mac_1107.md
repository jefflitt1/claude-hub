# Session Recap: mac_20260125_1107
**Time:** 2026-01-25 11:07
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~30000

## Completed
- Fixed system monitor Telegram alerts going to wrong bot (JGL Capital Bot → claude_system_alerts)
- Fixed false positive alerts for n8n/docker services on jeffn8nhost (updated service detection to use Docker container status and dockerd process name)
- Added `alert_when_offline: False` flag for Windows VM (WIN-FIUHCFK9UL6) to prevent alerts when VM is intentionally off
- Updated Critical Workflow Monitor in n8n to use correct Telegram bot token
- Fixed Weekly Backup workflow credential issue (switched to direct HTTP header auth)
- Deactivated broken Credentials Health Check workflow (n8n API doesn't support GET on /api/v1/credentials)
- Verified Telegram integration working with test message

## Decisions Made
- Use Docker container status check for n8n detection instead of pgrep
- Use dockerd process name for Docker daemon detection
- Make Windows VM monitoring non-alerting when offline (expected to be off sometimes)
- Route all system alerts to claude_system_alerts bot (8169830247:AAF_BStYa7AqKPbHCeErAl2oij17d7cJhyI)
