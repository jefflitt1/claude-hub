**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Fixed broken data references (projects.json prompt reference: l7-deals-prompt → l7-deals, l7-knowledge)
- Added missing skills to skills.json (investor-update, lease-summary) with status: planned
- Fixed XSS vulnerability - added escapeHtml() function and sanitized all template literals in index.html
- Added error boundaries - replaced Promise.all with Promise.allSettled for graceful degradation
- Added loading states with spinner CSS and per-section loading indicators
- Added try-catch and structured JSON logging to server.js
- Added request logging middleware with method, path, status, duration
- Added global error handler and 404 handler to Express
- Created comprehensive README.md with architecture, API docs, data schemas, development guides
- Created docs/SECURITY.md documenting webhook URL considerations and security recommendations

## Decisions Made
- Used Promise.allSettled instead of Promise.all so individual API failures don't break entire dashboard
- Structured logging format: JSON with timestamp, level, message, and contextual data
- Security doc recommends moving webhook URLs to env vars but notes current risk is low-medium

## New Open Items
- Consider implementing webhook authentication in n8n
- Consider API authentication if dashboard becomes public
- Consider input validation if write endpoints are added

## Notes
This was a continuation session focused on best practices review. The comprehensive review identified critical (XSS), high (error handling, logging), and medium priority issues. All were addressed in this session.
