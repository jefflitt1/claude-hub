# Session Recap: mac_20260130_2048
**Time:** 2026-01-30 20:48
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~24000

## Completed
- Diagnosed Jump Desktop connection failure to Mac Studio (network was fine, app was running — issue was a macOS TCC permission dialog blocking screen capture)
- Identified Telegram microphone access prompt as the blocking dialog
- Enabled Screen Sharing (VNC) on Mac Studio via SSH for fallback remote access
- Created `/Applications/DismissDialogs.app` on Mac Studio — a wrapper app that can dismiss macOS system permission dialogs remotely over SSH
- Added DismissDialogs.app to Accessibility permissions on Mac Studio
- Verified remote dialog dismissal works: `ssh jgl@100.67.99.120 'open /Applications/DismissDialogs.app'`

## Decisions Made
- Used .app bundle wrapper approach for Accessibility permissions (macOS won't accept raw binaries like /usr/bin/osascript)
- Used `open` command to launch the app (preserves app bundle context for Accessibility permissions, unlike direct script execution)

## New Open Items
- Consider adding passwordless sudo for `launchctl` on Mac Studio (currently only `pmset` is NOPASSWD)
- Mac Studio sudo password (0924) should be rotated or secured if exposed in session logs

## Notes
- macOS TCC permission dialogs are un-automatable by design — the only workaround is pre-granting Accessibility to an app that can interact with System Events
- Accessibility permissions persist across reboots but may reset on major macOS upgrades
- VNC/Screen Sharing is now enabled on Mac Studio as a fallback when Jump Desktop is blocked
- Quick fix command for future: `ssh jgl@100.67.99.120 'open /Applications/DismissDialogs.app'`
