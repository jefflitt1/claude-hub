**Time:** 2026-01-19 10:15 AM
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~100,000

## Completed
- Fixed Daily Digest n8n workflow scheduled trigger (switched from `$env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to predefined Anthropic credentials)
- Ran SQL migration for dashboard schema enhancement - 4 new tables created:
  - `workflow_categories` - seeded with 5 categories
  - `workflow_executions_summary` - for execution stats
  - `workflow_dependencies` - for workflow interconnections
  - `dashboard_sections` - seeded with 6 UI sections
- Configured Pi MCP Gateway credentials via SSH tunnel:
  - Added Brave API key (mcp-brave now working)
  - Added Postgres connection to local Supabase (mcp-postgres now working)
  - Created `~/mcp-gateway/.env` on Pi
- Updated documentation:
  - `docs/session-notes.md` - Added Session 4 entry
  - `docs/dashboard-enhancement-plan.md` - Marked Phase 1 complete
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Added new dashboard tables to schema section
  - Updated MCP Gateway status table with working Brave/Postgres

## Decisions Made
- Use predefined n8n credentials for API keys instead of environment variables (more reliable for scheduled runs)
- Connect Pi's mcp-postgres to local Supabase via host.docker.internal (not cloud Supabase)
- Skip Slack MCP for now (requires Slack app creation)

## New Open Items
- Set up Slack app for mcp-slack on Pi (requires api.slack.com configuration)
- Implement Phase 2-4 of dashboard enhancement (API endpoints, frontend updates, data sync)

## Skills Invoked
- recap

## Notes
- SSH to Pi works via cloudflared tunnel (`ssh pi`), not direct hostname
- Docker MCP stores credentials in encrypted keychain, not easily extractable
- Found Supabase service key in `~/.docker/mcp/config.yaml`
