# Session Recap: mac_20260119_1213
**Time:** 2026-01-19 12:13
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~50000

## Completed
- Set up Google Calendar MCP (`@cocal/google-calendar-mcp`) with OAuth authentication
- Set up Google Maps MCP via Docker MCP (8 tools: geocoding, directions, places, distance matrix, elevation, reverse geocode, place details, ping)
- Set up Google Sheets MCP (`@mcp-z/mcp-sheets`) with OAuth authentication
- Installed Node.js 24 via Homebrew for Sheets MCP compatibility (requires Node 24+)
- Configured Google Maps API key in Docker MCP secrets
- Removed HTTP referrer restrictions from Maps API key for server-side access
- Enabled multiple Google APIs in GCP project n8nl7-466320 (Geocoding, Places, Routes, Elevation)
- Created MCP service account in GCP (mcp-111@n8nl7-466320.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
- Verified all new MCPs connected: google-calendar, google-sheets, google-maps

## Decisions Made
- Used OAuth-based MCPs instead of service account auth (org policy blocks service account key creation)
- Switched from `mcp-google-sheets` to `@mcp-z/mcp-sheets` for proper OAuth support
- Kept existing `gdrive-L7` and `gdrive-JGL` for read-only Drive access (OAuth-based)
- Installed Node 24 as keg-only and configured Sheets MCP to use `/opt/homebrew/opt/node@24/bin/npx`
- Skipped Google Drive full CRUD setup due to org policy blocking service account keys

## New Open Items
- Google Drive full CRUD not available (org policy `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` blocks service account keys)
- Could explore Workload Identity Federation as alternative for Drive write access in future

## Notes
Full Google API integration now available via MCP:
- **Calendar**: Events, scheduling via OAuth
- **Sheets**: Read/write spreadsheets, formatting, batch operations via OAuth
- **Maps**: Geocoding, directions, places, distance matrix, elevation via API key
- **Drive**: Read-only access via existing OAuth servers (L7 + JGL)
- **Gmail**: Full access via unified-comms MCP (personal + L7)
