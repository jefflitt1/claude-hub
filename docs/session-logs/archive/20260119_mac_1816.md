**Time:** 2026-01-19 18:16
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~16,000

## Completed
- Reviewed Feedly integration implementation (continued from previous session)
- Added context-aware article surfacing to CLAUDE.md coaching behaviors
  - L7/CRE work triggers → suggest `/reading cre`
  - JGL/trading work triggers → suggest `/reading markets`
  - Learning discussions → mention `/reading learn`
- Evaluated 3 enhancement proposals for Feedly workflow
- Decided on lightweight approach (coaching prompts vs skill changes)

## Decisions Made
- Implemented Proposal 3 only (context-aware coaching) - user didn't see value in proposals 1-2 without assistance
- Deferred additional enhancements (auto-prompt habit logging, weekly saved review, quick mark-all-read)

## Files Changed
- `/Users/jeff-probis/CLAUDE.md` - Added 3 new coaching behaviors for article surfacing

## New Open Items
- None - Feedly integration phase 1 complete

## Notes
Session was continuation of previous Feedly integration work. The /reading skill and Industry Reading habit were already created. This session focused on tightening integration via coaching behaviors rather than adding more features. User preferred minimal friction approach.
