# Session Recap: mac_20260119_0932
**Time:** 2026-01-19 09:32
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~5,000

## Completed
- Verified approval flow environment is ready for testing
- Reviewed approval-flow-architecture.md documentation
- Confirmed Supabase tables (claude_approvals, claude_always_approvals) are empty/clean
- Verified PermissionRequest hook is configured in settings.json with 65s timeout
- Identified that current session has pre-approved tools (Bash, Write, etc.)

## Decisions Made
- Testing approval flow requires fresh Claude Code session (restart) since current session has tools pre-approved via allowedTools

## New Open Items
- Test approval flow end-to-end with fresh Claude Code session
- Verify Telegram notifications arrive within 1-2 seconds
- Verify "Always" button correctly stores pattern in claude_always_approvals
- Verify n8n callback sends "approveAlways" decision (not just "always")

## Notes
- Short verification session following earlier setup work (mac_20260119_0914)
- The approval flow components are in place: hook configured, Supabase tables created, n8n workflow ready
- User needs to restart Claude Code to test since allowedTools bypasses permission requests
