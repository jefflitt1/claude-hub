**Est. Tokens:** ~40,000

## Completed
- Finished SKILL.md update with all 10 Jeff-Agent v2.0 enhancements
- Added Quick Reference sections: Quick Actions (v2.0) and Advanced Commands (v2.0)
- Added full instructions for 9 new commands: `/jeff quick`, `/jeff log`, `/jeff task`, `/jeff respond`, `/jeff rules`, `/jeff conflicts`, `/jeff perma-trends`, `/jeff project-context`, `/jeff upcoming-actions`
- Added Model Optimization Guide (Haiku vs Sonnet routing for cost/speed)
- Added Email Thread Memory documentation
- Added Webhook Digest documentation (json/markdown/telegram formats)
- Added Version History section (v1.0 and v2.0)
- Updated inbox instructions to include email rules application step
- Built MCP server successfully (`npm run build`)
- Verified all 39 tools present including 14 new v2.0 tools

## Decisions Made
- Model routing strategy: Haiku for simple DB ops, Sonnet for analysis/generation
- Migration 003 must be run manually (MCP servers lack DDL permissions)

## New Open Items
- Run migration 003 in Supabase SQL Editor (creates jeff_email_rules, jeff_project_activity tables)
- Restart Claude Code to pick up rebuilt jeff-agent MCP server
- Test new tools with `/jeff quick` or `/jeff rules`
