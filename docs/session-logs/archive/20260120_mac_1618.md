# Session Recap: mac_20260120_1618
**Time:** 2026-01-20 16:18
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~40000

## Completed
- Fixed missing supabase-api credential in Master Telegram Bot Conversations workflow (8 nodes - 4 Load History + 4 Save History)
- Replaced credential references with inline HTTP headers using SUPABASE_KEY environment variable
- Fixed Process JGL node - was incorrectly using JGL Capital system prompt instead of Personal Assistant
- Fixed Load History JGL node - was filtering for JGLCapitalBot instead of JGLPersonalBot
- Validated all 4 bot pipelines (JGL Capital, JGL Personal, L7, Magic) - all connections intact
- Verified Cloudflare tunnel for claude-api.l7-partners.com is operational
- Used direct n8n API calls via Python when MCP partial update encountered validation errors

## Decisions Made
- Used inline HTTP headers instead of creating new n8n credential (more portable, no manual setup required)
- Cleaned n8n settings object to only include allowed fields to bypass API validation errors

## New Open Items
- None - all workflow fixes completed

## Notes
- Workflow ID: stlQoP2huGVmGzRS (Master Telegram Bot Conversations)
- Original error was Cloudflare Tunnel 530 + missing credential
- Tunnel was already restored when checked - likely temporary disconnection
- Telegram MCP having connection issues during testing, but workflow itself validated
