## Completed
- Fetched and analyzed Tom Tunguz article "AI Managing AI" (Jan 22, 2026)
- Added "Architectural Principles (Tunguz Framework)" section to CLAUDE.md
- Created visual constellation architecture diagram showing Claude as orchestrator
- Added key principles table (tool-calling threshold, management context, distillation economics)
- Added decision framework for when to route vs. handle directly
- Created Apple Note "Tunguz: AI Managing AI (Constellation Architecture)" for semantic search

## Decisions Made
- Placed Tunguz framework section before "Reference Docs" in CLAUDE.md
- Used ASCII diagram to visualize orchestrator → specialist routing pattern
- Stored in both CLAUDE.md (actionable reference) and Apple Notes (searchable)

## New Open Items
- None

## Notes
Short focused session adding external research to agent knowledge base. The Tunguz article validates the existing multi-agent architecture pattern in CLAUDE.md.
