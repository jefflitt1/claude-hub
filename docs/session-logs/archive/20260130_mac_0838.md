# Session Recap: mac_20260130_0838
**Time:** 2026-01-30 08:38 - 09:30
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~30000

## Completed
- Diagnosed Jump Desktop RDP "Connection closed by server" (Code: 0x5) on JLDesktop1 (PC1)
- Identified root cause: Windows 11 Pro session arbitration — console session (ITadmin/TradeStation) always wins over RDP
- Applied registry fixes: `fSingleSessionPerUser=0`, `Shadow=2` (didn't solve core Win Pro limitation)
- Logged off stale jglit disconnected RDP session, restarted TermService
- Checked Cloudflare tunnels — confirmed `trading-pc1.l7-partners.com` doesn't exist (only mac-studio + n8n-tunnel)
- Confirmed cloudflared not installed on JLDesktop1
- Downloaded and installed Jump Desktop Connect on PC1 via SSH (scheduled task workaround for UAC)
- Jeff connected monitor to complete JDC account pairing
- Confirmed Fluid protocol connection working — headless access to ITadmin console
- Updated PC1 verified config doc with Jump Desktop Connect resolution
- Updated PC2 migration gameplan with Phase 2.5 (install JDC before going headless) and lessons learned
- Updated CLAUDE.md to remove stale Cloudflare tunnel reference, set Fluid as primary access method
- Committed all IT docs to claude-agents repo

## Decisions Made
- Jump Desktop Connect (Fluid protocol) is the primary headless access method for Windows PCs — RDP is fallback only
- No Cloudflare tunnel needed for PC remote desktop — Tailscale + Fluid is sufficient
- PC2 must have Jump Desktop Connect installed before going headless (new Phase 2.5)

## New Open Items
- PC2 migration still pending — gameplan updated with JDC-first approach
- BIOS "Power On after AC loss" still needs physical access on PC1 and PC2

## Notes
- Windows 11 Pro session arbitration is a hard limitation — even with registry changes, RDP cannot coexist with an active console session for the same user
- Jump Desktop Connect silent install (`/S`) fails over SSH due to UAC — use scheduled task or physical access
- The `/recap` merge should update session-notes.md to Session 34
