## Completed
- Built complete Admin.L7 dashboard with 14 pages:
  - Dashboard (portfolio overview, alerts, quick actions)
  - Portfolio: Properties, Units, Occupancy
  - Tenants: List, Leases, Onboarding
  - Finance: Payments, Reports
  - Operations: Maintenance (Kanban), Vendors, Documents
  - Approvals (centralized queue)
  - Settings (users, company, notifications)
- Created AdminLayout with collapsible sidebar navigation
- Built useAdminData.ts hooks for all admin data fetching
- Implemented subdomain-aware routing in App.tsx
- Updated AdminLayout.tsx for subdomain path handling
- Deployed to admin.l7-partners.com (Cloudflare Access protected)
- Successfully separated TMS (tenant) from Admin.L7 (ownership) experience

## Decisions Made
- Used existing Portal (/portal/*) as model for tenant experience
- Admin routes work on both admin.l7-partners.com/* and l7-partners.com/admin/*
- Navigation paths auto-adjust based on hostname detection
- All admin pages wrapped with AdminProtectedRoute

## New Open Items
- None - Admin.L7 separation is complete

## Notes
The TMS/Admin portal separation is complete. The tenant-focused TMS remains at /portal/* while the new ownership/management dashboard is accessible at admin.l7-partners.com. Cloudflare Access provides authentication protection for the admin subdomain.
