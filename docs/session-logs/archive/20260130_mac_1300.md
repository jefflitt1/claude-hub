# Session Recap: mac_20260130_1300
**Time:** 2026-01-30 13:00-14:00
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~16000

## Completed
- Created `/jgl-team` skill file (`.claude/skills/jgl-team/SKILL.md`) — 6 named personas (Marcus Chen CIO, Sofia Reyes Trader, Raj Patel Quant, Alex Torres Systems, Diana Walsh Risk, Amir Hassan Analyst), meeting formats (standard, topic-focused, pulse, risk, ideas, review), external model consultation protocol
- Created `/built-sme` skill file (`.claude/skills/built-sme/SKILL.md`) — 20-year construction lending veteran persona, loan types, draw management, regulatory context, Built platform mapping
- Created `/built-sales` skill file (`.claude/skills/built-sales/SKILL.md`) — Chris Voss + Challenger Sale + MEDDPICC frameworks, call prep, objection handling, roleplay, pipeline review
- Created `/built-admin` skill file (`.claude/skills/built-admin/SKILL.md`) — Sales communications specialist, email drafting (cold/follow-up/champion/re-engage), meeting prep, CRM updates
- Reconciled `~/CLAUDE.md` vs `CLAUDE-personal.md`:
  - Added Built project + `/built-*` skills + `cloudflare` MCP to master `~/CLAUDE.md`
  - Updated grok-cli/deepseek-cli from "Tomorrow" to active
  - Fixed CLAUDE-personal.md: added missing skills (`/it`, `/jgl-team`, `/secretary`), fixed subagent names (`l7-analyst`→`property-analyst`, `trading-researcher`→`market-researcher`), fixed MCP names (`grok-mcp`→`grok-cli`), added JGL team table, added missing MCPs (tradestation, elevenlabs, tavily), updated redundant MCP status

## Decisions Made
- CLAUDE-personal.md serves as lightweight portable reference (same skills/MCPs/agents, no infrastructure details); ~/CLAUDE.md remains the comprehensive master loaded into all sessions
- All three CLAUDE files have distinct roles: ~/CLAUDE.md (master), claude-agents/CLAUDE.md (project-level claude-hub), claude-agents/CLAUDE-personal.md (lightweight portable)

## New Open Items
- P2 doc audit items still pending (from Session 41 secretary audit)
- All new skill files + CLAUDE changes uncommitted to git

## Skills Invoked
- recap
- done (earlier in session, before context compaction)
- jgl-team (created, not invoked)
- built-sme, built-sales, built-admin (created, not invoked)

## Notes
- This session continued from a compacted context — earlier work in the same session built the full Visualization & Parameter Optimization module (8 new files, 3 modified) and ran the secretary doc audit
- Session was focused on completing the 3 P1 items from the secretary audit
