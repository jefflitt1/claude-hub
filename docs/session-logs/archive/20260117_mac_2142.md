# Session Recap: mac_20260117_2142
**Time:** 2026-01-17 21:42 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~16000

## Completed
- Fixed System Health Check workflow - resolved 4 separate errors:
  - Added `N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE=false` to n8n docker compose
  - Updated Supabase keys from new format to legacy JWT format
  - Replaced Telegram node with HTTP Request (credential didn't exist)
  - Fixed IF condition to properly route healthy vs unhealthy status
- Activated and configured Weekly Backup workflow with Supabase credentials
- Activated and configured Daily Memory Graph Backup workflow with Supabase credentials
- All 3 Claude Hub monitoring workflows now active and working

## Decisions Made
- Use legacy JWT Supabase keys (eyJ...) instead of new sb_secret/sb_publishable format
- Use HTTP Request for Telegram API instead of n8n Telegram node (avoids missing credential issues)
- Proper Supabase credential pattern: `authentication: "predefinedCredentialType"` + `nodeCredentialType: "supabaseApi"` + credential reference

## New Open Items
- None

## Notes
Continuation session from context compaction. Focused on getting n8n Claude Hub workflows operational with proper Supabase and Telegram integration.
