**Time:** 2026-01-28 15:32
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~16,000

## Completed

- Created Apple Note "n8n Automation Knowledge Base" with all patterns and templates
- Exported session context to memory system
- Marked "Audit and consolidate n8n workflows" task as complete
- Logged milestone activity in claude-hub project

## Decisions Made
- Store n8n knowledge in Apple Notes for cross-device access
- Gmail AI Manager's prior-history detection pattern is valuable for jeff-agent enhancement
- Error handling 3-node pattern should be standardized across n8n workflows

## New Open Items
- Enhance jeff-agent email classification with prior-history detection (~20% accuracy improvement)
- Implement n8n error handling pattern across workflows
- Evaluate automation consulting services (AI Knowledge Base is #1 best seller)

## Notes
Session continued from context compaction. Key value extracted from Build Room Skool community n8n resources. The prior email history check pattern (query sent/inbox for sender) is the most immediately actionable enhancement for jeff-agent's email classification. Desktop/N8n folder now safe to archive/delete.
