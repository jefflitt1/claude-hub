# Session Recap: mac_20260126_2228
**Time:** 2026-01-26 22:28 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~14000

## Completed
- Audited all 37 active n8n workflows for Gmail nodes with "sent from n8n" attribution
- Identified 4 Gmail nodes across 3 workflows with appendAttribution enabled (default=true when null)
- Fixed Daily Agent Status Digest workflow (2 Gmail nodes: Send Daily Digest Email, Send Urgent SMS)
- Fixed ROI Calculator trigger workflow (1 Gmail node: Send a message)
- Fixed ROI Calculator Notification workflow (1 Gmail node: Send a message)
- Verified all 9 Gmail nodes across active workflows now have appendAttribution: false

## Decisions Made
- Used n8n REST API directly via curl since MCP l7_get_workflow only returns node type summaries
- Filtered PUT payload to only allowed fields (name, nodes, connections, settings) to satisfy n8n API validation
- Matched exact settings structure per workflow since they have different fields

## New Open Items
- None

## Notes
- Workflows already correctly configured: error trigger, L7 Partners website submission, Daily Sports Briefing
- Shell env var N8N_API_KEY requires explicit expansion in bash commands
- n8n API rejects extra properties on PUT - must filter to allowed fields only
