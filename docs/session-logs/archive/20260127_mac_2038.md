# Session Recap: mac_20260127_2038
**Time:** 2026-01-27 20:38
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~24000

## Completed
- Audited all 14 Cloudflare Access apps for IP bypass policy coverage
- Added Tailscale IP Bypass policy to Beszel (was missing)
- Added Tailscale IP Bypass policy to N8N (was missing)
- All apps now have consistent Tailscale IP bypass (100.85.201.111, 100.67.99.120, 100.102.117.40, 100.77.124.12, 32.218.43.29, 2605:d580:1400:88c::/64)
- Investigated Cloudflare WARP vs Tailscale for phone access — decided to stick with Tailscale

## Decisions Made
- Use Tailscale (not Cloudflare WARP) for phone access to l7-partners.com apps — avoids iOS VPN conflict since only one VPN can run at a time
- Tailscale IPs are stable across wifi/cellular, solving the original problem without adding WARP complexity

## New Open Items
- Extend session durations to 30 days on all Access apps (MCP update_access_app has a bug requiring app type field — do manually in Zero Trust dashboard)
- Uninstall 1.1.1.1/WARP apps from MacBook and iPhone (not needed with Tailscale approach)
- Verify iPhone Tailscale IP is in the bypass list (check Tailscale app on phone)

## Notes
- Cloudflare MCP `update_access_app` fails with "app type is missing or invalid" — tool doesn't pass required `type` field on updates
- WARP was downloaded on both devices but enrollment failed (no device enrollment policy configured in Zero Trust) — moot since we chose Tailscale
- 3 apps have public bypass (Open WebUI Assets, Open WebUI Static, webhook bypass) — intentional
