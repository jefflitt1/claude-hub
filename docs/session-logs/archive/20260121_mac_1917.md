# Session Recap: mac_20260121_1917
**Time:** 2026-01-21 19:17
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~12000

## Completed
- Researched best approach for running 2 TradeStation instances on Mac Studio
- Discovered critical issue: Parallels has documented freezing with TradeStation on Mac Studio Ultra (network I/O bottlenecks)
- Changed recommendation from Parallels to VMware Fusion Pro (free since Nov 2024)
- Updated `03-cloudflare-tunnel.sh` with RDP routes for trading VMs:
  - `trading-vm1.l7-partners.com` → RDP to VM1
  - `trading-vm2.l7-partners.com` → RDP to VM2
  - Added DNS record creation for both hostnames
  - Added VM IP placeholder instructions
- Updated `windows-vms-setup.md`:
  - Changed platform recommendation to VMware Fusion Pro
  - Added complete "Remote Access via RDP" section
  - Added Cloudflare tunnel RDP commands
  - Added VM IP configuration for bridged networking
- Updated `~/.claude/agents/it-infrastructure.md` with remote access strategy

## Decisions Made
- VMware Fusion Pro for Windows VMs (not Parallels - freezing issues with trading apps)
- RDP via Cloudflare tunnel for remote access (encrypted, works from anywhere)
- Bridged networking for stable VM IPs

## New Open Items
- Need 2x Windows 11 Pro ARM64 licenses (~$400 total)
- Configure actual VM IPs in tunnel config after VM creation

## Notes
Research found Parallels forum threads documenting TradeStation freezing on Mac Studio Ultra due to network I/O bottlenecks during live trading. VMware Fusion Pro (now free) is more stable for real-time trading workloads.
