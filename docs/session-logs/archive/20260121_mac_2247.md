# Session Recap: mac_20260121_2247
**Time:** 2026-01-21 22:47 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~16,000

## Completed
- Fixed Telegram callback flow for mobile approvals workflow (VLodg6UPtMa6DV30)
- Replaced Telegram Callback Trigger with standard webhook node (path: telegram-callback)
- Added missing webhookId property to Callback Webhook node
- Converted Answer Callback to HTTP Request with correct bot token
- Converted Edit Message to HTTP Request with correct bot token
- Converted Reject Unauthorized to HTTP Request with correct bot token
- Converted Edit Message (Cleanup) to HTTP Request with correct bot token
- Registered Telegram webhook via setWebhook API pointing to n8n endpoint
- Verified end-to-end callback flow: user clicked approve button, callback received, message edited to "OK APPROVED by Jeff"

## Decisions Made
- Use standard webhook + HTTP Request nodes instead of native Telegram nodes to ensure correct bot token (8338596281) is used consistently
- Webhook path: telegram-callback at webhooks.l7-partners.com

## New Open Items
- security_audit_log table missing 'source' column (non-critical, logging only)

## Notes
Root cause of callback failure was credential mismatch - messages sent via HTTP with correct token but native Telegram callback trigger used different credential. Fixed by converting all callback-related Telegram nodes to HTTP Request approach.
