# Session Recap: mac_20260128_1000
**Time:** 2026-01-28
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~10000

## Completed
- Provided SSH setup commands for Windows PC #1 (192.168.4.46) — OpenSSH Server install requires admin elevation
- Provided full inventory audit PowerShell commands for Windows PC #1 (OS edition, installed software, disk usage, user folder sizes, running services, startup programs, hardware summary)
- Provided Windows license check guidance (Pro vs Home for RDP support, RETAIL vs OEM for transferability)
- Provided same SSH setup + full audit commands for Windows PC #2 (192.168.4.45)
- Noted VirtualBox host-only adapter (192.168.56.1) on PC #2 — may have VMs to inventory

## Decisions Made
- Cannot SSH directly from Mac — Windows PCs need OpenSSH Server installed first (requires admin PowerShell)
- User will run commands locally and paste output for analysis
- Both PCs planned for deprecation — full audit before shelving

## New Open Items
- Run audit commands on both Windows PCs and review output
- Check `slmgr /dli` popup output on both PCs for license edition and channel (Pro/Home, RETAIL/OEM)
- Investigate VirtualBox VMs on PC #2 (192.168.56.1 adapter detected)
- Export/save Windows Pro license keys before shelving (if RETAIL, they're transferable)
- Check for SSH keys, browser data, credentials on both PCs before wiping

- PC #2: 192.168.4.45, user jglit, NordLynx VPN active, VirtualBox adapter present
- Both PCs on same local network (192.168.4.x/22)
