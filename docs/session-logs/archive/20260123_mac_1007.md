# Session Recap: mac_20260123_1007
**Time:** 2026-01-23 10:07 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~6,000 (3 turns × 2000)

## Completed

- Created transition plan knowledge base directory structure (`~/claude-agents/docs/knowledge-base/transition-plan/`)
- Added comprehensive Raspberry Pi infrastructure documentation to knowledge base
  - Full markdown doc: `raspberry-pi-infrastructure.md` (comprehensive IT handoff document)
  - Knowledge base README with document standards
- Created Apple Note mirror: "Raspberry Pi Infrastructure - IT Handoff (ATTENTION: IT Agent)"
- Created high-priority IT agent task for review (jeff-agent task ID: `2f8524a7-27d0-40e2-b09c-67d133358e9c`)
  - Tagged with: `it-agent`, `infrastructure`, `transition-plan`, `raspberry-pi`, `documentation`
  - Project: claude-hub

## Documentation Preserved

The Raspberry Pi infrastructure doc includes:
- Executive summary of production-grade system
- Hardware specs (Pi 5, 16GB RAM, 128GB + USB SSDs)
- Container orchestration (Docker Compose multi-file strategy)
- Core services: n8n, Supabase (self-hosted), Weaviate, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Appsmith, Metabase
- Cloudflare Tunnel security (zero exposed ports)
- Backup & disaster recovery (nightly backups to local + Google Drive)
- Monitoring & self-healing configuration
- Cron schedules (`/etc/cron.d/n8n-jobs`)
- Design philosophy: immutable infrastructure, infra-as-code
- Quick reference cards for ports and critical paths

## Decisions Made

- Knowledge base location: `~/claude-agents/docs/knowledge-base/transition-plan/`
- IT agent attention mechanism: high-priority task with `it-agent` tag + Apple Notes mirror
- Document standards established in README for future transition docs

## New Open Items

- IT Agent task pending review (high priority)
- Consider: 1-page executive PDF, network diagram, runbook format (future deliverables mentioned in source doc)

## Notes

This was a quick session focused on documenting the Raspberry Pi infrastructure for IT handoff. The source documentation was comprehensive and production-grade, not experimental.
