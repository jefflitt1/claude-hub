# Session Recap: mac_20260130_1045
**Time:** 2026-01-30 10:45
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~30000

## Completed
- Deactivated Windows product keys on both VMs (slmgr /upk + /cpky) before deletion
- Quit UTM app on Mac Studio via SSH
- Deleted UTM.app from /Applications on Mac Studio
- Cleaned UTM preferences, caches, and saved state
- Rebooted Mac Studio to attempt container cleanup
- Verified all Mac Studio services healthy post-reboot (Ollama, Claude HTTP Server, iMessage bridge)
- Confirmed VM disk images fully removed (only 104KB empty container stubs remain, SIP-protected but inert)
- VM decommission complete — JLDesktop (PC1) is now the sole Windows/TradeStation machine

## Decisions Made
- Windows product key HQN4V-HWBRB-KKM8P-YJG4D-YBHX3 confirmed already applied to JLDesktop (PC1)
- Leaving 104KB SIP-protected container stubs (harmless, macOS won't let them be deleted remotely)
- UTM approach fully retired in favor of dedicated PC hardware

## New Open Items
- BIOS "Power On after AC loss" still pending on JLDesktop (requires physical access)
- Consider removing any remaining VM references from n8n credentials or scripts

## Notes
- macOS SIP prevents deletion of ~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.* even with sudo — these are managed by containermanagerd
- Reboot did not auto-clean orphaned containers as expected, but they contain no VM data (40K + 32K + 32K = 104KB total)
- All Mac Studio services auto-recovered after reboot successfully
