# Session Recap: mac_20260119_2141
**Time:** 2026-01-19 21:41
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Diagnosed session-checkpoint.py hook issue (script moved but hook referenced old path)
- Verified fix already in place (symlink + updated hook config pointing to claude-agents/scripts/)
- Created missing symlink for sync-analytics.py at ~/.claude/scripts/
- Verified all MCP server entry points exist
- Verified no broken symlinks in ~/.claude/
- Checked log file sizes (healthy: 70K, 18K, 1.7K)
- Confirmed claude_session_context table exists in Supabase

## Decisions Made
- TradeStation MCP credentials to be configured tomorrow

## New Open Items
- Configure TradeStation MCP with real credentials

## Notes
Quick maintenance session. The session-checkpoint.py issue from earlier was already properly fixed via symlink. The only gap was sync-analytics.py which wasn't symlinked, causing silent failures on analytics sync at session end.
