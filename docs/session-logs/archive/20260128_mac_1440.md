# Session Recap: mac_20260128_1440
**Time:** 2026-01-28 14:40
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~60000

## Completed
- Set up second Raspberry Pi (raspberrypi) with full remote access stack
- Enabled SSH on Pi (was disabled by default - case-sensitive commands lesson)
- Installed and configured Tailscale on secondary Pi (IP: 100.95.8.67)
- Disabled Tailscale key expiry for both Pis
- Security hardening: disabled root SSH, installed fail2ban
- Enabled Tailscale SSH for passwordless access
- Disabled unnecessary services (cups, ModemManager, bluetooth)
- Switched Pi from Wayland to X11 for better VNC compatibility
- Installed x11vnc on both Pis with auto-start systemd services
- Configured VNC on n8n Pi (jeffn8nhost, 100.77.124.12)
- Configured VNC on son's Pi (raspberrypi, 100.95.8.67)
- Re-enabled auto-login for son's Pi desktop
- Updated IT infrastructure documentation with both Pi configs
- Added Jump Desktop quick reference table
- Added to CLAUDE.md: Tailscale network table with all device IPs
- Exported session to memory graph

## Decisions Made
- Use VNC (x11vnc) instead of RDP (xrdp) - better compatibility with auto-login
- Switched from Wayland to X11 on son's Pi for VNC compatibility
- Son's Pi keeps auto-login enabled (no password needed for local use)
- Both Pis use x11vnc with systemd auto-start
