**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~12,000

## Completed
- Fixed Telegram bot credential routing for system alerts
- Updated System Health Check workflow (btzTPdQPMQNBwujF) to use L7 Action Items Bot credential (wi08dcbxZEEx61tR)
- Updated Weekly IT Security Scan workflow (UBnTTrQrT8EnaC0f) to use L7 Action Items Bot credential (wi08dcbxZEEx61tR)
- Both workflows previously used JeffN8NCommunicationBot (rnodyIjRrNxnmYkd) which is intended for interactive approvals

## Decisions Made
- Established bot separation architecture:
  - @JeffN8NCommunicationbot (rnodyIjRrNxnmYkd) = Interactive approvals (Claude Code Mobile Approvals)
  - @claudeterminal1463bot / L7 Action Items Bot (wi08dcbxZEEx61tR) = One-way system alerts

## New Open Items
- None

## Notes
- This was a continuation session from earlier Telegram bot audit work
- n8n_update_partial_workflow had issues; used n8n_update_full_workflow with minimal settings instead
