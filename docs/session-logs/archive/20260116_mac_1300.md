**Terminal:** mac

## Completed

### L7 Partners Design Review
- Comprehensive site review from Graphic Designer perspective (brand, colors, typography, UI/UX)
- Comprehensive site review from Real Estate Consultant perspective (industry language, features, tenant experience)
- Compiled priority recommendations (high/medium/low)

### L7 Partners Code Fixes (Pushed)
- Footer: Replaced text "L7" badge with actual logo image (inverted for dark bg)
- Footer: Replaced placeholder Twitter link with functional phone link
- Contact form: Added visual divider with "Space Requirements" label between basic and industrial fields

### Magic Infrastructure Documentation
- Reviewed all magic components on Resources page
- Documented app integrations: WebFX (card), CubeSmith (cube), Streets Pro (maps), Inject (Something Extra), Modern Oracle (8 Ball)
- Updated ~/magic.md with full "L7 Partners Magic Infrastructure" section including schemas, force systems, and extension ideas
- Updated ~/l7partners-rewrite/CLAUDE.md with magic infrastructure summary

### Magic Widget Real-Time Updates (Pushed)
- Card Prediction (WebFX): Added 3-second polling for real-time updates
- Cube Prediction (CubeSmith): Added 3-second polling for real-time updates
- MagicMapsWidget: Added Supabase real-time subscription for instant updates when shortcut pushes link
- MagicMapsWidget: Added 30-second expiration polling (preserves natural revert to Google Maps)
- Added cross-fade transitions when images change
- Fixed blob URL memory cleanup bug
- Each widget now operates with completely isolated state

## Decisions Made
- Option A (polling) chosen for WebFX/CubeSmith since their APIs don't support push notifications
- Supabase real-time used for MagicMapsWidget since we control that data layer
- 3-second polling interval balances responsiveness vs network load
- Map widget stealth preserved - still shows "Google Maps" labels, magic link silently activates/deactivates

## New Open Items
- Lovable prompt ready for hero section and WhyChoose card visual enhancements (not yet submitted)
- Portal/TMS backend work deferred: payment history views, lease views, communication logs, clear heights field

## Notes
- Session continued from previous context that was compacted
- All changes pushed to GitHub and synced with Lovable
- Magic infrastructure now fully documented for future reference and extension
