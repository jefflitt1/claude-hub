# Session Recap: mac_20260119_1055
**Time:** 2026-01-19 10:55
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Created jeff-agent MCP server package (12 tools for task/email/project management)
- Created database migration for 4 tables (jeff_tasks, jeff_email_threads, jeff_associations, jeff_contacts)
- Ran migration in Supabase - all 4 tables created with indexes
- Created /jeff skill definition with commands (inbox, tasks, digest, project)
- Registered jeff-agent MCP server in ~/.claude.json
- Updated ~/CLAUDE.md with jeff skill and MCP server references
- Updated session-notes.md with Session 8 summary

## Decisions Made
- Used same patterns as l7-business MCP for consistency
- Auto-infer projects from email domains and content keywords
- Store email drafts in DB rather than sending directly (email authority model)
- Wrap unified-comms for actual email send operations

## New Open Items
- Restart Claude Code to load jeff-agent MCP server
- Test /jeff skill commands after restart

## Notes
Jeff Agent is a personal assistant for email management, task tracking, and project oversight. It integrates with unified-comms for email operations and uses Supabase for persistence. The association engine automatically links emails, tasks, and projects based on domain rules and content keywords.
