# Session Recap: mac_20260116_2115
**Time:** 2026-01-16 21:15 EST
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Installed MCP Gateway (Supergateway) on Pi via Docker
- Created `~/mcp-gateway/docker-compose.yml` with 7 MCP servers
- Started all containers: Filesystem (8808), Memory (8810), GitHub (8812), Brave (8813), Puppeteer (8814), Slack (8815), PostgreSQL (8816)
- Verified MCP SSE endpoints working (tested 8808, 8810)
- Updated session-notes.md with Session 7 documentation (architecture, commands, endpoints)
- Committed and pushed changes to claude-hub repo

## Decisions Made
- Use Supergateway to expose MCP servers over HTTP/SSE (not stdio)
- Skip Cloudflare tunnel for MCP - local access sufficient for n8n use case
- Keep MCP servers on localhost only (more secure, lower latency)

## New Open Items
- Configure API keys for Brave, Slack, PostgreSQL MCP servers (`~/mcp-gateway/.env`)
- Create n8n workflow to test MCP integration locally
- Fix n8n MCP API auth (blocked by Cloudflare Access - needs service token)

## Notes
- SSH tunnel via cloudflared was unstable during session; used `ssh pi-local` (direct LAN) instead
- Cloudflare dashboard automation blocked by Turnstile bot protection
- MCP Gateway designed for n8n to call locally, not for external access
