## Completed

### Built Technologies Project Setup
- Built Technologies company research - comprehensive intelligence from web, Contrary Research, CNBC
- Created `~/Desktop/Built_Technologies_Briefing.md` (10-section, ~5 page company briefing)
- Built project added to Active Projects in CLAUDE.md
- Created project directory at `~/Documents/Claude Code/claude-agents/projects/built/`

### Three Built Agents Created
- `/built-sme` - Construction finance SME (loan types, draws, lien waivers, compliance, regulatory context)
- `/built-sales` - Chris Voss + Challenger Sale + MEDDPICC frameworks (call prep, objections, discovery, role-play)
- `/built-admin` - Email drafting, meeting notes processing, CRM updates, internal comms

### Registry Updates
- Added 3 agents to `data/agents.json`
- Added 3 skills to `data/skills.json`
- Added Built project to `data/projects.json`
- Added Built skills to Key Skills table in `~/CLAUDE.md`

### Sales Training Research
- Compiled Tier 1/2/3 training resources (a16z B2FI guide mentions Built as case study)
- Added Gong data-backed discovery rules to built-sales skill
- Added three negotiator types framework (Analyst, Assertive, Accommodator)

### Gemini CLI Fix Attempted
- Fixed `~/.gemini/settings.json` format (`selectedAuthType` key)
- Still requires interactive browser login to complete OAuth

## Decisions Made
- Built project uses consultant-type agents (sales enablement, not codebase)
- Deferred Airtable discussion - revisit based on Built's internal CRM
- DeepSeek R1 used for market analysis (Gemini had auth issues)

## New Open Items
- Gemini CLI needs interactive browser login (`gemini` in terminal)
- YouTube video review pending (user shared link, need video details to incorporate)
- Built's internal CRM unknown - may need Salesforce MCP
- User's specific role/segment at Built not confirmed

## Notes
Major session focused on setting up Built Technologies sales enablement project. Three agents created with comprehensive skill files. Company briefing document ready for onboarding prep. a16z B2FI guide identified as essential reading (Built mentioned as case study).
