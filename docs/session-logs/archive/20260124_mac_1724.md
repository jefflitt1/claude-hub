# Session Recap: mac_20260124_1724
**Time:** 2026-01-24 17:24
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~24000

## Completed
- Audited MacBook vs Mac Studio configurations to identify migration gaps
- Synced 12 skills to Mac Studio (jeff, reading, consult, recap, done, deal-analysis, n8n, n8n-setup, context-loader, coach, telegram-setup, workflow-coach)
- Synced 5 agents to Mac Studio (l7-analyst, trading-researcher, email-drafter, code-reviewer, it-infrastructure)
- Synced missing ~/.config directories (google-sheets-mcp, google-tasks-mcp)
- Fixed corrupted .zshrc env vars on Mac Studio (XAI_API_KEY had \n break)
- Added all API env vars to Mac Studio (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, N8N_APPROVAL_WEBHOOK, N8N_CLEANUP_WEBHOOK, XAI_API_KEY, DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)
- Discovered Mac Studio reachable via local network (192.168.5.38) when Tailscale was disconnected
- Updated SSH config with `studio` (local) and `studio-remote` (Cloudflare) aliases
- Created mac-studio-verify.sh and mac-studio-sync-missing.sh scripts on Desktop

## Decisions Made
- Use local network IP (192.168.5.38) as primary SSH route to Mac Studio
- Keep Tailscale as backup (`studio-tailscale` alias)
- Verified GitHub SSH works on Mac Studio (jefflitt1 authenticated)

## New Open Items
- Tailscale not logged in on MacBook (may want to re-enable)
- Mac Studio Docker environments: "default" and "desktop-linux" contexts (both part of Docker Desktop, normal)

## Notes
- Jump Desktop was used to access Mac Studio visually while SSH/Tailscale was down
- Copy-paste through Jump Desktop corrupts multi-line commands (heredocs break)
- Direct SCP via local network worked for bulk file transfer
