# Session Recap: mac_20260117_1517
**Time:** 2026-01-17 15:17
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Verified Supabase API keys working (no fix needed)
- Confirmed parent_id column already exists in claude_projects
- Populated claude_agents table with 5 subagents (bash, explore, plan, general-purpose, claude-code-guide)
- Populated claude_skills table with 7 skills (done, recap, n8n, n8n-setup, guide, deal-analysis, frontend-design)
- Linked 3 existing workflows to projects (removed as placeholders)
- Synced 12 active n8n workflows from n8n.l7-partners.com to Supabase
- Updated MCP server platform statuses (4 servers: n8n-mcp, gdrive-JGL, github-mcp, supabase-mcp)
- Added 6 new MCP servers (gmail, gmail-l7, memory, brave, playwright, puppeteer)
- Added system prompts to claude_prompts (CLAUDE.md, guide skill)
- Verified file paths - cleaned up references to non-existent files (code-standards.md, l7-knowledge.md, missing skill files)
- Added 4 Claude Hub tasks for future work
- Reviewed dashboard architecture (Lovable/Supabase vs legacy Express/JSON)

## Decisions Made
- Use actual n8n workflow IDs as database IDs for claude_workflows
- Remove placeholder workflow entries that don't match real n8n workflows
- Only track prompts/skills that have actual files on disk
- Supabase is source of truth; local JSON files are legacy

## New Open Items
- Create missing skill files: done.md, recap.md, n8n.md, deal-analysis.md
- Add dashboard views for agents and skills tables
- Create l7-knowledge.md file for L7 operations
- Set up automated n8n workflow sync
