# Session Recap: mac_20260117_1459
**Time:** 2026-01-17 14:59 EST
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed

- Created `/done` skill for end-of-session workflow (recap + merge + commit + exit confirmation)
- Verified `SessionEnd` hook exists in Claude Code (can be used for session management)
- Tested Daily Digest n8n workflow - execution 4771 succeeded, emails sent
- Verified claude.l7-partners.com DNS is working - site protected by Cloudflare Access (302 redirect to login)
- Diagnosed Supabase MCP issue - not in Docker MCP catalog, needs alternative approach
- Discovered Supabase legacy API keys are disabled (since 2025-09-16) - blocking schema updates

## Decisions Made

- Created `/done` skill instead of hooking recap to exit (hooks can only run shell commands, not Claude skills)
- Will use Supabase REST API or n8n Supabase node for schema updates instead of MCP
- Workflow: type `/done` before `exit` to ensure session progress is logged

## New Open Items

- Re-enable Supabase legacy API keys OR get new publishable/secret keys from dashboard
- Update Supabase schema: add `parent_id` column to `claude_projects`
- Delete duplicate Claude Hub entry in Supabase (keep the "active" one with URL)
- Set parent relationships: `l7partners-rewrite.parent_id = 'l7-partners'`
- Update n8n Supabase credentials if using new API keys

## Notes

- Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/donnmhbwhpjlmpnwgdqr/settings/api
- The 6am Daily Digest failure was due to old workflow version (before JSON fix) - current version works
- Docker MCP Supabase server exists in CLI registry but NOT in Docker Desktop GUI catalog
