# Session Recap: mac_20260120_1241
**Time:** 2026-01-20 12:41
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Fixed duplicate Telegram bot notifications by separating bot responsibilities
- Removed webhook from @claudeterminal1463bot (now one-way notifications only)
- Backed up outdated local workflow file (~/.claude/n8n-claude-approval-workflow.json.bak)
- Verified bot separation working correctly:
  - @JeffN8Ncommunicationbot: Interactive approvals (two-way via n8n)
  - @claudeterminal1463bot: System health notifications (one-way only)

## Decisions Made
- All interactive approval requests route through JeffN8Ncommunicationbot via n8n
- claudeterminal1463bot reserved for one-way system notifications (no webhook needed)
- Local workflow file deprecated in favor of server-side n8n workflow

## New Open Items
- (none)

## Notes
- Continued from stuck terminal investigating Terminal1463 bot source
- Primary approval system uses n8n webhook with JeffN8N credential (rnodyIjRrNxnmYkd)
- Fallback path still sends to claudeterminal1463bot but without callback handling
