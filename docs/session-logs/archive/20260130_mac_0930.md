# Session Recap: mac_20260130_0930
**Time:** 2026-01-30 09:30 - 10:10
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~40000

## Completed
- Diagnosed orchart Telegram alert source — traced to `central_collector.py` running via `com.l7.system-monitor` LaunchAgent on Mac Studio
- Disabled orchart alerts permanently (renamed LaunchAgent `.plist` to `.disabled` via n8n SSH workflow)
- Fixed Mac Studio SSH access — correct user is `jgl` (not jeff/jglit), key auth works
- Fixed Pi SSH access — correct user is `jeffn8n` (not jglit/pi/jeff)
- Fixed Mac Studio display sleep — set `displaysleep=0`, `powernap=0`, disabled screen saver lock, `SleepDisabled=1`
- Removed stale Tailscale VM devices (user did manually via web console)
- Created Uptime Kuma "TradeStation (Desktop1)" TCP monitor on 100.69.59.111:3389
- Updated Cloudflare tunnel — added `mac-vnc.l7-partners.com` (VNC) and `trading-pc2.l7-partners.com` (placeholder)
- Enabled VNC/Screen Sharing on Mac Studio — toggled Remote Management settings for VNC access, port 5900 confirmed open
- Enabled Jump Desktop Connect Screen Recording permission on Mac Studio
- Updated CLAUDE.md with Mac Studio and Pi Quick References, SSH users, tunnel hostnames
- Added Google Tasks item: test Jump Desktop remote access from cellular

## Decisions Made
- Remote Management (ARD) supersedes Screen Sharing toggle — expected behavior on macOS
- Cloudflare tunnels for RDP/VNC require cloudflared client — Tailscale + Jump Desktop Fluid preferred for remote desktop
- n8n "Fix Claude HTTP Server" workflow used as remote execution vehicle for Mac Studio commands via SSH
- Jump Desktop Connect (Fluid) + VNC are primary remote access methods for Mac Studio

## New Open Items
- Test Jump Desktop from cellular/off-WiFi network (added to Google Tasks)
- PC2 migration — gameplan at `docs/it-agent/PC2-migration-gameplan.md`
- Delete jglit profile on PC1 (user wants to review first)
- Update central_collector.py when both PCs are live to monitor physical desktops
- Mac Studio n8n SSH credential lacks passwordless sudo — limits remote admin capabilities

## Notes
- Used n8n workflow modification pattern extensively: save original → modify nodes → PUT via API → trigger webhook → restore original
- Mac Studio SSH user `jgl`, Pi SSH user `jeffn8n` — documented in CLAUDE.md Quick References
- Uptime Kuma credentials confirmed: jeff / L7monitors!
- Session spanned two context windows (compaction occurred mid-session)
