**Time:** 2026-01-23 21:33
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~15,000

## Completed
- Created comprehensive Claude system migration package for Mac Studio
- Packaged 13 skills (recap, jeff, reading, consult, done, deal-analysis, etc.)
- Packaged 5 agents (it-infrastructure, l7-analyst, trading-researcher, email-drafter, code-reviewer)
- Created claude-system-full.tar.gz (68K) with complete ~/.claude contents
- Created claude-agents-scripts.tar.gz (19K) with automation scripts
- Created cli-configs.tar.gz for grok-cli and deepseek configs
- Extracted zshrc-exports.txt with environment variables (SUPABASE, N8N, XAI, DEEPSEEK)
- Created 07-extract-claude-system.sh automated extraction script
- Created mac-studio-migration.zip (123K) single-file transfer package
- Updated README.md with new extraction instructions
- Added Windows PC audit outstanding item to it-infrastructure.md and windows-vms-setup.md
- Opened AirDrop for transfer to Mac Studio

## Decisions Made
- Single zip file preferred for AirDrop transfer (easier than multiple files)
- Extraction script handles all setup steps automatically
- Environment variables added to .zshrc via script (not manual)

## New Open Items
- Transfer mac-studio-migration.zip to Mac Studio via AirDrop
- Run ./07-extract-claude-system.sh on Mac Studio
- Verify skills work with /recap and /jeff tests

## Notes
This session focused on replicating the complete Claude Code system from MacBook to Mac Studio. The migration package now includes everything needed: skills, agents, scripts, settings, hooks, CLI configs, and environment variables. The extraction script automates the entire setup process.

Files in migration package:
- claude-system-full.tar.gz (skills, agents, approval-handler, http-server, settings)
- claude-agents-scripts.tar.gz (session-init.py, session-checkpoint.py, etc.)
- cli-configs.tar.gz (grok-cli, deepseek)
- zshrc-exports.txt (env vars)
- CLAUDE.md (context file)
- 07-extract-claude-system.sh (extraction script)
