# Session Recap: mac_20260120_1138
**Time:** 2026-01-20 11:38
**Terminal:** mac
**Project:** L7 Partners - Frigate NVR
**Est. Tokens:** ~34,000

## Completed
- Deployed Frigate NVR v0.16.3 on home Pi (192.168.4.147) via Docker
- Created docker-compose.yml and optimized config template
- Identified 3 Dahua NVR camera systems: 200 E 2nd St (16ch), 191 E 2nd St (TBD), 261 Suburban (TBD)
- Discovered network topology: NVRs on 192.168.1.x, Pi on 192.168.4.x (different locations)
- Designed Tailscale subnet router solution using Pi Zeros
- Created comprehensive OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md on Pi with staggered detection strategies
- Researched Hailo AI HAT 2 setup for when it arrives (driver v4.19, PCIe Gen 3)
- Saved complete project state to: session-context MCP, Apple Notes, Jeff Tasks

## Decisions Made
- Use Tailscale for secure remote access (not port forwarding)
- Single Pi Zero at 200 E 2nd St covers both 200 + 191 NVRs (same 192.168.1.x subnet)
- Staggered detection: 5 FPS (high priority), 3 FPS (medium), 1 FPS (low)
- Dual-stream config: substream for AI detection, mainstream for recording

## New Open Items
- User to deploy Pi Zero at 200 E 2nd St (192.168.1.x network)
- User to deploy Pi Zero at 261 Suburban
- User to provide SSH access to Pi Zeros
- User to provide NVR credentials for all 3 systems
- User to provide 191 E 2nd St NVR IP and channel count
- User to provide 261 Suburban NVR IP and channel count
- Install Hailo AI HAT 2 when it arrives

## Skills Invoked
- recap

## Notes
- Project paused waiting for hardware (Pi Zeros at remote locations)
- All state saved for easy resume - say "resume Frigate setup" when ready
- Critical reminder: Pi Zero at 200 E 2nd St must advertise entire 192.168.1.0/24 subnet
