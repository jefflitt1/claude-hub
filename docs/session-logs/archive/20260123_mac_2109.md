# Session Recap: mac_20260123_2109
**Time:** 2026-01-23 21:09
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~60,000

## Completed
- Audited Raspberry Pi 5 (jeffn8nhost.local) - full Docker inventory, services, cron jobs
- Identified 14 Supabase containers, n8n, Frigate, Appsmith, Metabase, Weaviate, Elasticsearch running
- Documented Pi infrastructure in comprehensive IT-ready format (paste cache)
- Audited current MacBook Pro M4 Pro Homebrew/npm packages
- Discovered MacBook has 125 Homebrew formulas, Docker running gmail-mcp containers
- Clarified Mac Studio (192.168.5.38) is the NEW machine, not target of audit
- Used mDNS discovery (dns-sd) to find network hosts

## Decisions Made
- VMware Fusion Pro recommended over Parallels for TradeStation VMs (documented freezing issues with Parallels)
- Windows VMs spec: 4 cores, 16GB RAM, 128GB disk each
- Pi infrastructure is production-grade, not a hobby setup (documented for IT handoff)

## New Open Items
- **Software audit of two Windows trading PCs** - Still need IP addresses and credentials
- User mentioned pulling IP/license info from PCs earlier today but location not found
- Need to search earlier session transcripts or ask user for PC connection details

## Notes
Session focused on infrastructure audit for Mac Studio migration. Successfully audited Pi and identified current MacBook, but the two Windows PCs that need auditing for TradeStation migration were not located. The migration docs (windows-vms-setup.md) detail how to set up the VMs but don't contain the actual PC IPs. User explicitly clarified they don't want the new Mac touched - only the two old Windows PCs.
