# Session Recap: mac_20260117_2018
**Time:** 2026-01-17 20:18 EST
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Fixed n8n workflow "GitHub → Supabase Project Sync" (KQ2bleG4vj728I4f)
- Resolved Supabase authentication issue - changed HTTP Request nodes from `genericCredentialType` to `predefinedCredentialType`
- Tested workflow execution 5359 - completed successfully
- Verified data upserted to `claude_projects` table in Supabase
- Cleaned up test record after verification

## Decisions Made
- Use `predefinedCredentialType` with `nodeCredentialType: "supabaseApi"` for HTTP Request nodes calling Supabase API (properly injects auth headers)
- `genericCredentialType` does NOT work with Supabase API credentials in HTTP Request nodes

## New Open Items
- None

## Notes
Original error was "access to env vars denied" from Code nodes using `$env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`. Previous session had switched to using credentials, but used wrong credential type (`genericCredentialType`). This session identified `predefinedCredentialType` as the correct approach for HTTP Request nodes with Supabase credentials.
