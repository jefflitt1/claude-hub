# Session Recap: mac_20260120_1808
**Time:** 2026-01-20 18:08 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~12,000

## Completed
- Diagnosed n8n "Daily Agent Status Digest" workflow causing 3 duplicate emails
- Identified root cause: Merge node using default "Append" mode was firing downstream nodes for each of 3 parallel data sources
- Fixed Merge node configuration: changed to "Combine" mode with "combineAll" to wait for all inputs
- Fixed connection routing: each data source now connects to separate Merge input index (0, 1, 2)
- Workflow updated and active - fix will take effect at 6 AM tomorrow

## Decisions Made
- Use Merge node "Combine" mode with "combineAll" instead of default "Append" for fan-in patterns

## New Open Items
- Verify fix works tomorrow (single digest email at 6 AM)

## Notes
User reported receiving 3 identical Daily Agent Digest emails this morning. Investigation revealed the workflow fans out to 3 parallel queries (Projects, Agents, Session Notes) which all feed into a Merge node. The default Append mode was causing each completed query to trigger the rest of the workflow separately. The fix ensures the Merge node waits for all 3 inputs before proceeding.
