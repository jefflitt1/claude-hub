# Session Recap: mac_20260123_1107
**Time:** 2026-01-23 11:07 UTC
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~50,000

## Completed
- Clarified DNS/hosting architecture: Cloudflare manages DNS, Netlify hosts sites
- Confirmed l7-partners.com is served by Netlify (not Lovable despite dashboard showing "Live")
- Decided on `admin.l7-partners.com` as subdomain for new L7 management dashboard
- Deployed jgl-capital-terminal as new Netlify site (`jglcap.netlify.app`)
- Configured `jglcap.l7-partners.com` with DNS verification TXT record
- Confirmed Cloudflare Access protection working for jglcap subdomain
- Cleaned up Lovable custom domains (removed stale l7-partners.com config)
- Removed jglcap from old Netlify site aliases
- Decided to retire unused Appsmith admin.l7 setup

## Decisions Made
- Use `admin.l7-partners.com` for new L7 management dashboard (includes TMS content)
- Keep Cloudflare Access protection on jglcap.l7-partners.com
- Separate Lovable projects = separate Netlify sites (jglcap vs main l7 app)
- Same Lovable project with subdomain routing = domain aliases on one Netlify site (claude., jgl.)

## New Open Items
- Build out admin.l7-partners.com dashboard in Lovable (add subdomain route)
- Update Cloudflare CNAME for `admin` to point to Netlify when ready

## Notes
Session focused on infrastructure cleanup and understanding the DNS/hosting architecture. User has a clean setup now: Cloudflare for DNS + Access protection, Netlify for hosting, Lovable for development. Multiple subdomains on main L7 app use internal routing based on hostname.
