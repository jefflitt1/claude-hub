**Time:** 2026-01-17 11:31
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed
- Explored existing L7 Partners infrastructure (TMS, tenant portal, agents, skills, n8n workflows)
- Expanded L7 Partners from "website project" to comprehensive "business entity" with 5 domains in projects.json
- Added 3 new L7 agents to agents.json: l7-deals-agent, l7-investor-agent, l7-docs-agent
- Created deals agent knowledge base (~/claude-agents/prompts/l7-deals.md) with investment criteria, pro forma framework, due diligence checklist
- Created `/deal-analysis` skill with quick, standard, and full modes (~/.claude/skills/deal-analysis/skill.md)
- Registered deal-analysis skill in skills.json
- Reviewed Supabase database schema - identified L7 data model (l7.properties, l7.units, l7.tenants, l7.leases)
- Configured Supabase MCP server (supabase-l7) with OAuth in ~/.claude.json
- Added supabase-l7 to mcp-servers.json tracking

## Decisions Made
- L7 Partners expanded to 5 business domains: Property Management (active), Acquisitions (building), Investor Relations (planned), Asset Management (planned), Leasing (planned)
- Chose OAuth method for Supabase MCP over Personal Access Token (browser-based, no token needed)
- Restricted Supabase MCP to project_ref=donnmhbwhpjlmpnwgdqr for security

## New Open Items
- Restart Claude Code to activate Supabase MCP
- Authenticate Supabase via browser popup on first use
- Query live property data for 3 L7 properties (200 East 2nd, 261 Suburban, 191 East 2nd)
- Create prompts/knowledge files for l7-investor-agent and l7-docs-agent
- Build additional skills: /lease-summary, /investor-update, /market-report

## Notes
- L7 properties in Supabase: property_id '200' = 200 East 2nd Street (operational), property_id '191' = 191 East 2nd Street (development, 20k SF)
- 261 Suburban Ave not found in migrations - may be in live database only
- Data lives in `l7` schema with public views (properties_l7, tenants_l7, leases_l7, units_l7)
