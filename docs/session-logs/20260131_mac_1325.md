# Session Recap: mac_20260131_1325
**Time:** 2026-01-31 13:25
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~50000

## Completed
- Investigated TradeStation CAL "Failed to create file finfo.txt" error on desktop1 — root cause: file permissions + Windows Defender blocking
- Added Windows Defender exclusions for TradeStation folders on both desktops
- Disabled all Windows notifications on desktop1 (toast, notification center, weather widget, news & interests, tips/suggestions, widgets board)
- Disabled all Windows notifications on desktop2 (same set)
- Disabled Chrome desktop notifications on desktop1 via Group Policy registry (DefaultNotificationsSetting=2)
- Renamed desktop2 computer name to JLDesktop2 (confirmed in Tailscale)
- Installed Jump Desktop Connect on desktop2 — now showing in My Computers sidebar
- Verified Jump Desktop Connect service set to auto-start on desktop2
- Disabled Tailscale key expiry on both desktops
- Full reboot test on desktop2 — auto-login, Tailscale, and all services confirmed working
- Set up SSH key auth from Mac to both desktops (fixed administrators_authorized_keys newline issue)
- Added SSH config aliases: `ssh desktop1` (100.69.59.111) and `ssh desktop2` (100.68.163.47)
- Created jeff-agent task for BIOS Power On After AC Loss (both desktops, deferred — requires physical access)
- Identified TSBackupRestore "Out of storage space" notification on desktop1 — TradeStation backup tool, not cloud storage

## Decisions Made
- Jump Desktop Connect (Fluid protocol) is standard for both desktops — RDP as fallback only
- SSH key auth uses administrators_authorized_keys (Windows OpenSSH requirement for admin accounts)
- BIOS Power On After AC Loss deferred to next physical access (task created)
- TradeStation backup storage issue deferred — user chose to move on

## New Open Items
- TradeStation backup "Out of storage space" on desktop1 — investigate backup location and clean up or expand
- Both desktops need BIOS Power On After AC Loss configured (jeff-agent task created)

## Notes
- Desktop1 user profile folder is still `C:\Users\claudeadmin\` (cannot rename without profile recreation) but computer name is JLDesktop
- sshpass was essential for initial key deployment since no prior key auth existed
- Windows OpenSSH for admin users ignores per-user authorized_keys — must use C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys
- echo >> in Windows cmd doesn't add newline before appending — caused keys to merge on one line; fixed with PowerShell Set-Content array syntax
