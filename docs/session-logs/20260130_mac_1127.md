# Session Recap: mac_20260130_1127
**Time:** 2026-01-30 11:27 AM
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~50,000

## Completed
- Ran comprehensive IT agent health check on JLDesktop (PC1) — all services confirmed working (SSH, Tailscale, RDP, TradeStation auto-start, watchdog)
- Identified hardware as Dell XPS 8940 (docs incorrectly listed HP OMEN) — corrected everywhere
- Migrated jglit user profile to ITadmin: TradeStation data (18.2GB), Downloads (1.9GB), Pictures (26MB) copied to C:\Users\claudeadmin\
- Backed up jglit Desktop (1.1GB incl. Investing folder) to D:\jglit-backup\Desktop\ (C: drive was full)
- Recreated 4 TradeStation backup scheduled tasks under ITadmin with correct paths
- Deleted 9 junk scheduled tasks (GoToMeeting, Zoom, Firefox, WD Agent, Windows feeds)
- Fixed SSH administrators_authorized_keys permissions for ITadmin key auth
- Verified no system dependencies on jglit (no services, no registry refs, no env vars, no shares)
- Deleted jglit user account and profile — reclaimed ~63GB on C: drive (0.5GB → 63.8GB free)
- Confirmed SSH works as ITadmin (`ssh ITadmin@100.69.59.111`)
- Updated CLAUDE.md: SSH command, hardware model, storage specs, removed jglit credentials, added deletion note
- Updated JLDesktop-PC1-verified-config.md: user accounts, SSH refs, hardware, added changelog
- Updated tech-stack-inventory.md: added full JLDesktop device section at top
- Updated decommissioned-devices.md: marked JLDesktop as recommissioned (done by linter/user with VM decommission details)
- Shut down JLDesktop for physical relocation — auto-start sequence confirmed (ITadmin auto-login → TradeStation)

## Decisions Made
- jglit profile worth removing: 63GB on 235GB drive (27%) + stale user with active tasks is maintenance liability
- Two clean accounts (ITadmin + Administrator) is the right setup
- Desktop files backed up to D: drive (not C:) due to space constraints during migration
- AppData (40GB caches) not worth preserving — all temp/browser data
- BIOS power-on-after-AC-loss deferred (Jeff unable to access F10 during this move)

## New Open Items
- [ ] BIOS "Power On after AC loss" on Dell XPS 8940 (F10 at boot, requires physical access)
- [ ] Verify JLDesktop boots correctly after relocation (auto-login + TradeStation)
- [ ] Locked registry stubs in C:\Users\jglit\ will clean up on first reboot

## Skills Invoked
- /recap

## Notes
- Session focused entirely on JLDesktop (PC1) infrastructure cleanup
- Machine is a Dell XPS 8940, NOT HP OMEN as previously documented
- C: drive has two partitions: 235GB SSD (OS) + 1TB HDD (D: data)
- All IT agent docs updated so future sessions have correct context
