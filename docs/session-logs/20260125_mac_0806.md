# Session Recap: mac_20260125_0806
**Time:** 2026-01-25 08:06
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~120000

## Completed
- Fixed Claude Terminal Bot to run on Mac Studio instead of MacBook Pro
- Updated working directory paths from `/Users/jeff-probis/...` to `/Users/jgl/...` in n8n workflows
- Fixed Claude HTTP server binary path from `~/.local/bin/claude` to `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`
- Added PATH environment variable to spawned processes in HTTP server
- Changed HTTP server binding from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0` for LAN access
- Switched n8n workflow API endpoint from Cloudflare tunnel (`https://claude-api.l7-partners.com`) to direct LAN IP (`http://192.168.5.38:3847`)
- Updated "Claude Terminal" node in Master Telegram Bot workflow with correct HTTP method (POST), body settings, and URL
- Updated "Claude Code HTTP Executor" workflow to use LAN IP
- Verified bot responds with correct hostname: `Jeffs-Mac-Studio.local`

## Decisions Made
- Use direct LAN IP instead of Cloudflare tunnel (tunnel DNS route was misconfigured in Cloudflare dashboard)
- Keep HTTP server listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) for flexibility

## New Open Items
- Cloudflare tunnel DNS route for `claude-api.l7-partners.com` needs manual fix in Cloudflare dashboard (currently not routing to mac-studio tunnel)
- Consider adding HTTP server as a launchd service for persistence across reboots

## Notes
- The previous working configuration (2026-01-21) was running on MacBook Pro, not Mac Studio
- The mac-studio tunnel was created on 2026-01-24, after the last working execution
- Two successful Telegram bot executions confirmed after fix (IDs 11865, 11868)
