# Session Recap: mac_20260128_2136
**Time:** 2026-01-28 21:36
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~50000

## Completed
- Hid external drives from macOS desktop (SanDisk backup drive)
- Disabled SanDisk Unlocker partition auto-mount via /etc/fstab
- Diagnosed Windows 1 VM memory pressure (16GB VMs on 32GB system)
- Stopped Windows 2 to free RAM for TradeStation in Windows 1
- Fixed broken TradeStation startup script (ts.bat had malformed path)
- Deleted broken ts.bat, kept working TradeStation.bat
- Set up SSH access to Windows VMs via Tailscale (user: jeff, password: 0924)
- Diagnosed TradeStation OAuth callback URL mismatch error
- Fixed TradeStation MCP auth.cjs to use correct callback URL (http://localhost:3000 instead of /callback)
- Updated ~/.claude/settings.json with correct TRADESTATION_REDIRECT_URI

## Decisions Made
- Use fstab with noauto flag to prevent SanDisk Unlocker partition from mounting
- TradeStation default callback URLs don't include /callback path - must use bare localhost:3000
- Windows VM username is "jeff" with password "0924" for SSH access

## New Open Items
- TradeStation API credentials not configured (need TRADESTATION_CLIENT_ID and TRADESTATION_CLIENT_SECRET from TradeStation)
- Need to contact TradeStation Client Experience to request API access if not already done
- Consider reducing VM RAM allocation (6GB each instead of 8GB) for running both VMs simultaneously

## Notes
- Windows 1 IP: 100.95.217.59 (Tailscale), 192.168.64.2 (local)
- SanDisk Unlocker UUID: ED89994A-0AD3-32E1-A4F5-EA7A57CF6959
