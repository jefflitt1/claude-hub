# Session Recap: mac_20260119_1620
**Time:** 2026-01-19 16:20 EST
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~24,000 (12 turns)

## Completed
- Created Feedly MCP server from scratch in meta-tools workspace
- Implemented 10 MCP tools: feedly_profile, feedly_collections, feedly_subscriptions, feedly_all_articles, feedly_stream, feedly_saved_articles, feedly_unread_counts, feedly_mark_read, feedly_save_for_later, feedly_search_feeds, feedly_info
- Researched Feedly API authorization flow for personal accounts
- Walked user through developer token generation at feedly.com/v3/auth/dev
- Configured feedly MCP server in ~/.claude.json with access token
- Updated meta-tools workspace package.json to include feedly
- Built and verified the MCP server compiles successfully
- Documented Feedly credentials in jeff-agent task system
- Verified API token works with curl test

## Decisions Made
- Built Feedly MCP as TypeScript in meta-tools (consistent with existing servers)
- Used same patterns as l7-business MCP (caching, zod schemas, formatResponse helper)
- Token stored in ~/.claude.json env vars (same as other MCP servers)

## New Open Items
- Restart Claude Code to load new feedly MCP server
- Test feedly_info after restart to verify working
- Consider adding token refresh automation (token expires Feb 19, 2026)

## Files Changed
- Created: ~/Documents/Claude Code/claude-agents/projects/meta-tools/feedly/package.json
- Created: ~/Documents/Claude Code/claude-agents/projects/meta-tools/feedly/tsconfig.json
- Created: ~/Documents/Claude Code/claude-agents/projects/meta-tools/feedly/src/index.ts
- Modified: ~/Documents/Claude Code/claude-agents/projects/meta-tools/package.json (added feedly to workspaces)
- Modified: ~/.claude.json (added feedly MCP config with token)

## Notes
User has Feedly Pro Plus account (500 API requests/day limit). Token expires Feb 19, 2026. Refresh token stored in jeff-agent task for future reference.

Next session: restart Claude Code, then test with "what's new in my feeds?" or similar.
