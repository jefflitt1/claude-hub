# Session Recap: mac_20260116_1020
**Time:** 2026-01-16 10:20-10:35 EST
**Terminal:** Mac

## Completed

1. **Reviewed session context** - Read session-notes.md, identified open items from Jan 15
2. **Registered recap skill properly** - Created `~/.claude/skills/recap.md` with YAML frontmatter for Claude Code skill system
3. **Generated SSH key for Pi** - Created `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
4. **Added SSH key to Pi** - User added key to Pi's authorized_keys
5. **Added webhook to l7partners-rewrite** - Now syncs to Supabase dashboard on push
6. **Created agents.json** - Tracks Claude agents (recap-agent, magic-agent, explore-agent)
7. **Created skills.json** - Tracks Claude Code skills (recap, frontend-design, n8n-setup, n8n)
8. **Pushed new entity types to GitHub** - Webhook triggered sync to Supabase
9. **Set up Pi GitHub sync** - Created `~/sync-claude-hub.sh` with cron job (every 5 min)
10. **Added pi-local SSH alias** - `ssh pi-local` for direct LAN access (no cloudflared)

## Decisions Made

- Recap skill uses Claude Code's native skill system (`~/.claude/skills/`) with YAML frontmatter
- Only l7partners-rewrite repo worth adding webhook (other repos are stale/2025)
- Entity types: projects, agents, skills, prompts, workflows, mcp-servers
- Pi auto-sync via cron (every 5 min) rather than webhook-triggered pull

## New Open Items

1. Verify n8n workflow syncs agents/skills to Supabase (may need workflow update)
2. Check if Supabase needs `claude_skills` table added
3. Update dashboard (Lovable) to display agents and skills

## Notes

- SSH aliases: `pi` (via cloudflared tunnel), `pi-local` (direct LAN)
- n8n MCP list_workflows returning error (API bug?) - use n8n web UI instead
- Previous session logs from Jan 15 still pending merge
