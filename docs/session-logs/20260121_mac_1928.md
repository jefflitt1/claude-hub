# Session Recap: mac_20260121_1928
**Time:** 2026-01-21 19:28
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~14,000

## Completed
- Researched Grok CLI options (official Grok Build coming Feb 2026, community grok-cli available with MCP support)
- Researched other LLMs to integrate (DeepSeek R1/V3, Ollama local models)
- Created comprehensive model comparison for 5 LLMs (Claude, Gemini, Codex, Grok, DeepSeek)
- Saved xAI API key to `~/.config/grok-cli/config.json`
- Saved DeepSeek API key to `~/.config/deepseek/config.json`
- Added API keys as env vars to `~/.zshrc` (XAI_API_KEY, DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with expanded multi-model collaboration section (5 models)
- Added model strengths comparison table with costs, capabilities, and use cases
- Added "When to Use Each Model" decision matrix for all 5 models
- Added model-specific sweet spots for Grok 4 and DeepSeek R1/V3
- Added Local Models section for 32GB Mac Studio (Ollama compatibility)
- Created tomorrow's migration plan in pending-sql.md
- Documented hardware: 32GB Mac Studio M2 Max baseline

## Decisions Made
- Will integrate both Grok 4 and DeepSeek as MCP servers
- Will set up Ollama for local model inference (privacy-sensitive work)
- Recommended local models: deepseek-r1:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, gemma3:27b
- API-based primary, local as fallback for sensitive data

## New Open Items
- Install grok-cli npm package
- Install Ollama and pull local models
- Create grok-cli MCP server (following gemini-cli pattern)
- Create deepseek-cli MCP server (API + Ollama fallback)
- Update /consult skill with Grok and DeepSeek routing

## Notes
User has 32GB Mac Studio M2 Max - good for local 32B models. Full 5-model stack will be: Claude (primary) + Gemini (1M context) + Codex (refactors) + Grok (real-time) + DeepSeek (cheap reasoning). Tomorrow's migration is fully planned with API keys pre-configured.
