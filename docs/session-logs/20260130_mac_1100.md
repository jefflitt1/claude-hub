## Completed
- Reviewed PC1 (JLDesktop) SSH/Tailscale setup — confirmed SSH over Tailscale is the most efficient access method for Claude Code
- Fully provisioned JLDesktop2 (PC2) as second trading workstation:
  - Created ITadmin account with auto-login
  - Created jglit account with SSH key auth (admin)
  - Installed and configured OpenSSH Server
  - Installed Tailscale (IP: 100.68.163.47)
  - Configured power settings (no sleep, no hibernate, monitor off 5min)
  - Disabled unnecessary Windows services (WSearch, DiagTrack, SysMain)
  - Enabled RDP
  - Set up firewall rules (Tailscale, SSH, RDP)
  - Renamed computer to JLDesktop2
- Set up TradeStation auto-start on PC2 via scheduled task
- Removed NordVPN from both PC1 and PC2
- Removed TeamViewer from PC2
- Disabled Windows notifications on both PC1 and PC2 (toast, notification center, tips)
- Fixed SSH key auth for PC1 from this MacBook (pushed key to administrators_authorized_keys, set owner to SYSTEM)
- Discovered jglit user doesn't exist on PC1 — SSH now uses ITadmin account
- VM Windows license keys deactivated (slmgr /upk + /cpky)
- Created JLDesktop2-PC2-verified-config.md documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with PC2 in device roles, Tailscale network table, quick reference
- Updated JLDesktop-PC1-verified-config.md with NordVPN removal note

## Decisions Made
- PC2 SSH uses jglit account (local), PC1 SSH uses ITadmin account
- Scheduled task approach for TradeStation auto-start (more reliable than Startup folder over SSH)
- NordVPN fully removed from both PCs (was interfering with Tailscale networking)
- Windows firewall re-enabled with explicit allow rules rather than leaving disabled

## New Open Items
- Rename desktop-ts → JLDesktop2 in Tailscale admin console
- Disable key expiry for JLDesktop2 in Tailscale admin
- BIOS: Power On after AC loss on PC2 (requires physical access)
- PC2 reboot verification test (confirm full auto-start sequence end-to-end)

## Skills Invoked
- recap

## Notes
- NordLynx adapter on PC2 was causing Tailscale connectivity issues even with NordVPN disconnected
- Windows OpenSSH is strict about administrators_authorized_keys ownership — must be SYSTEM-owned
- PC2 original hostname was Desktop-TS, Wi-Fi connected (no ethernet)
- Terminal line-break wrapping was a persistent issue when pasting commands on PC2
