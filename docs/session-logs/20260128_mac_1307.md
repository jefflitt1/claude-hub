# Session Recap: mac_20260128_1307
**Time:** 2026-01-28 13:07
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~30000

## Completed
- Set up second Raspberry Pi (jglit@raspberrypi) for remote access
- Enabled SSH on Pi (was disabled by default)
- Installed and configured Tailscale on Pi
- Authenticated Pi to Tailscale network (IP: 100.95.8.67)
- Disabled key expiry in Tailscale admin
- Installed xrdp for Jump Desktop remote access
- Security hardening: disabled root SSH login
- Installed fail2ban for SSH brute-force protection
- Enabled Tailscale SSH (passwordless SSH via Tailscale identity)
- Disabled unnecessary services (cups, ModemManager, bluetooth)
- Cleaned up old kernel packages (~500MB freed)
- System fully updated

## Decisions Made
- Pi will use low-power mode instead of Wake on LAN (Pi hardware doesn't support true WoL)
- Tailscale SSH enabled for passwordless access from authenticated devices
- xrdp for Jump Desktop instead of VNC (better compatibility)

## New Open Items
- Add Pi to Jump Desktop on MacBook and Mac Studio (user action)
- Consider what services/tasks this Pi will run
