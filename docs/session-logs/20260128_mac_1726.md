## Completed
- Created full IT agent (`~/.claude/agents/it-agent.md`) with 541 lines of comprehensive infrastructure knowledge
- Added `/it` skill (`~/.claude/skills/it/SKILL.md`) for quick IT lookups
- Documented all 7 Tailscale devices with IPs and access methods
- Documented all 21+ MCP servers with auth types and sharing status
- Documented all 72 n8n workflows (categorized by purpose)

- Added local LLM (Ollama) configuration and models
- Added TradeStation API details (24hr refresh requirement)
- Added backup & disaster recovery procedures
- Added Tavily MCP server with new API key (`tvly-prod-...`)
- Created search tools decision guide (Tavily vs WebSearch vs Brave vs Feedly vs Gemini vs Grok)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with `/it` skill and `it-agent` subagent
- Updated CLAUDE.md to mark Tavily as primary search tool (replacing Brave)
- Analyzed Obsidian vs current stack (recommended against adding)
- Analyzed Vercel vs current stack (recommended against adding)

## Decisions Made
- IT agent implemented as both skill (`/it`) and subagent (`it-agent`)
- Tavily is primary search tool, Brave kept as backup for image/video
- Obsidian not needed - Memory MCP + Apple Notes covers knowledge management
- Vercel not needed - Netlify + Cloudflare already covers hosting

## New Open Items
- Restart Claude session to activate Tavily MCP
- Rotate compromised Supabase API key (flagged in credentials_inventory)
- Configure Gmail L7 app password (needs_config status)

## Notes
- IT agent has full knowledge of: devices, MCP servers, n8n workflows, credentials, Cloudflare, Tailscale, Jump Desktop
- Search tool hierarchy: Tavily (research) > WebSearch (quick) > Brave (images) > Feedly (feeds)
