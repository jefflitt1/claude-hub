# Session Recap: mac_20260128_0659
**Time:** 2026-01-28 06:59
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~10,000

## Completed
- Investigated Tailscale authentication/re-auth popup issue
- Confirmed node key expiry settings are correct (all devices set to "Expiry disabled")
- Identified root cause: GitHub OAuth IdP session expires every 30 days (Tailscale-enforced, non-configurable)
- Disabled admin console inactivity timeout
- Evaluated whether a Tailscale MCP would be useful (concluded: over-engineering for this use case)

## Decisions Made
- No Tailscale MCP needed - 6 machines is too small scale to justify programmatic management
- Accepted 30-day re-auth as expected behavior (doesn't affect mesh network operations)

## New Open Items
- None - issue resolved (understood as expected behavior)

## Notes
The Tailscale re-auth prompts are for the control plane (admin console), not the mesh network itself. SSH, Ollama access, and all device-to-device traffic continues uninterrupted regardless of IdP session state. The 30-day hard expiry is a Tailscale security feature tied to GitHub OAuth, not something that can be disabled.
