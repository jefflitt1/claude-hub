# Session Recap: mac_20260124_1938
**Time:** 2026-01-24 19:38
**Terminal:** mac
**Est. Tokens:** ~60,000 (30 turns)

## Completed
- Configured Mac Studio login items (Docker, Tailscale, Telegram, UTM, Flic)
- Added apps to Dock (Cursor, Telegram, Terminal, Flic)
- Downloaded and installed Flic Mac app for button automation
- Fixed Tailscale duplicate device issue - clean reinstall as exit node (100.67.99.120)
- Verified all 10 LaunchAgents running (Ollama, Cloudflare, Claude services, etc.)
- Verified Docker containers running (Scrypted, Home Assistant, Node-RED, Uptime Kuma, Homebridge, Mosquitto)
- Verified Cloudflare tunnels connected (mac-ssh, mac-studio, n8n-tunnel)

## Decisions Made
- Pushcut cannot run on Mac (iOS only) - user needs dedicated iOS device for Flic → iPhone Shortcut automation
- Flic Mac app installed as alternative for Mac-based button automations
- Abandoned old Tailscale identity (.80) in favor of fresh registration (.120) due to reclaim issues

## New Open Items
- Clean up Windows Tailscale duplicates (win-fiuhcfk9ul6 vs -1)
- Consider Keyboard Maestro for Flic → complex Mac automations
- Pushcut still needs iOS device for iPhone Shortcut triggering
- UTM VMs (Windows 1, Windows 2) - decide if they should auto-start

## Notes
- User has M4 Max Mac Studio as always-on home server
- Significant time spent debugging Tailscale duplicate entries - lesson learned about Tailscale not reclaiming old identities
- magic.md referenced but doesn't exist yet
