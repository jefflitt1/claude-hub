**Time:** 2026-01-15 22:16 UTC
**Terminal:** mac

## Completed

- **Reviewed open items** - Analyzed session-notes.md to identify what's pending
- **Cleaned up task list** - Removed MCP setup items (user handling separately), confirmed cloudflared is working (HTTP 200), kept clone/deploy on list
- **Updated data schema** - Enhanced mcp-servers.json with platform status (mac/pi) and usedBy connections
- **Added prompts.json data** - Magic Agent Context and Claude Hub Context entries
- **Added workflows.json data** - n8n Health Check workflow entry
- **Added API endpoints** - `/api/mcp-servers`, `/api/prompts`, `/api/workflows` to server.js
- **Created Lovable dashboard prompt** - Full spec at `prompts/lovable-dashboard-v1.md` with component breakdown, data schema, visual style, and layout
- **Pushed to GitHub** - Commit: "Add improved data schema and Lovable dashboard prompt"

## Decisions Made

- cloudflared confirmed working - removed from open items
- MCP setup being handled by user separately - removed from Claude's tracking
- Added UI configuration as new open item (Claude structures data, creates Lovable prompts)

## New Open Items

- Give Lovable prompt to Lovable to build React dashboard
- (User) Complete Pi storage fix and MCP credential setup

## Notes

Session focused on preparing for Lovable UI development. Data files now have richer schema with platform status and bidirectional connections. The Lovable prompt includes full API specs, component requirements, and visual style guide.
