## Pro Forma Framework

### Income Assumptions
```
Gross Potential Rent (GPR)
- Current contract rent (per rent roll)
- Mark-to-market adjustments
- Absorption of vacant space (timeline)

Less: Vacancy & Credit Loss
- Stabilized vacancy: 5-7% for multi-tenant
- Credit loss: 1-2%

Effective Gross Income (EGI)
+ Other Income (CAM recoveries, parking, storage)

Operating Expenses
- Property taxes (verify with assessor)
- Insurance (get actual quotes)
- Utilities (if not triple-net)
- R&M (typically $0.50-1.00/SF)
- Management (3-5% of EGI)
- CAM/Admin (if not recovered)

Net Operating Income (NOI)

Less: Capital Reserves ($0.15-0.25/SF annually)

Cash Flow Before Debt Service
```

### Key Metrics to Calculate
1. **Cap Rate** = NOI / Purchase Price
2. **Cash-on-Cash** = Annual Cash Flow / Equity Invested
3. **DSCR** = NOI / Annual Debt Service (target > 1.25x)
4. **Break-even Occupancy** = (Expenses + Debt Service) / GPR
5. **IRR** = Internal rate of return over hold period
6. **Equity Multiple** = Total Distributions / Initial Equity

### Market Rent Analysis
When analyzing in-place rents vs. market:
- Industrial NNN rents typically $6-15/SF depending on market
- Annual escalations: 2.5-3.5% or CPI-based
- Consider tenant improvement costs for new leases ($5-15/SF)
- Leasing commissions: 4-6% of total lease value
